1. C. The correct answer is spear phishing. Spear phishing is
targeted to a specific group, in this case insurance professionals.
Although this is a form of phishing, the more specific answer is
the one you will need to choose on questions like this. Phishing
uses social engineering techniques to succeed but is once again a
broader answer than spear phishing and thus is not the correct
choice. Finally, a Trojan horse pretends to be a legitimate or
desirable program or file, which this scenario doesn’t describe.
■
2. B. A logic bomb is malware that performs its malicious activity
when some condition is met. A worm is malware that selfpropagates.
A Trojan horse is malware attached to a legitimate
program, and a rootkit is malware that gets root or
administrative privileges.
■
3. C. This is a very basic form of SQL injection. Cross-site
scripting would have JavaScript in the text field and would be
designed to impact other sites from a user’s session. Cross-site
request forgery would not involve any text being entered in the
web page, and ARP poisoning is altering the ARP table in a
switch; it is not related to website hacking.
■
4. B. This describes a jamming attack, where legitimate traffic is
interfered with by another signal. Jamming can be intentional or
unintentional and may be intermittent. IV attacks are obscure
cryptographic attacks on stream ciphers. Wi-Fi protected setup
(WPS) uses a PIN to connect to the wireless access point (WAP).
The WPS attack attempts to intercept that PIN in transmission,
connect to the WAP, and then steal the WPA2 password. A
botnet is a group of machines that are being used, without their
consent, as part of an attack.
■
5. B. The best option listed to defend against the attacks
mentioned is input validation. Encrypting the web traffic will
not have any effect on these two attacks. A web application
firewall (WAF) might mitigate these attacks, but it would be
secondary to input validation, and an intrusion detection system
(IDS) will simply detect the attack—it won’t stop it.
■
6. C. If users have been connecting but the AP does not show
them connecting, then they have been connecting to a rogue
access point. This could be the cause of an architecture and
design weakness such as a network without segmentation and
control of devices connecting to the network. Session hijacking
involves taking over an already authenticated session. Most
session hijacking attacks involve impersonation. The attacker
attempts to gain access to another user’s session by posing as
that user. Clickjacking involves causing visitors to a website to
click on the wrong item. Finally, bluejacking is a Bluetooth
attack.
■
7. C. Cross-site scripting involves entering a script into text areas
that other users will view. SQL injection is not about entering
scripts, but rather SQL commands. Clickjacking is about tricking
users into clicking on the wrong thing. Bluejacking is a
Bluetooth attack.
■
8. D. Retaining the actual password is not a best practice, and
thus encrypting password plain text is not a common technique
to make passwords harder to crack. Since the application would
need the cryptographic key to read the passwords, anybody who
had access to that key could decrypt the passwords. Using a salt,
a pepper, and a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed for
passwords are all common best practices to prevent offline
brute-force attacks.
■
9. A. Although this is one of the more dated items on the
Security+ exam outline, you need to know that the term for
Internet messaging spam messages is SPIM. The rest of the
answers were made up, and though this shows up in the exam
outline, the rest of the world has moved on from using this term.
■
10. B. A segmentation fault will typically stop the program from
running. This type of issue is why a NULL pointer or other
pointer de-referencing error is considered a potential security
issue, as a denial-of-service condition impacts the availability of
the service. This type of error is unlikely to cause a data breach
or allow privilege escalation, and permissions creep occurs as
individuals accrue more permissions over time in a single
organization as their permissions are not cleaned up when they
switch positions or roles.
■
11. C. The machines in her network are being used as bots, and the
users are not aware that they are part of a distributed denial-ofservice
(DDoS) attack. Social engineering is when someone tries
to manipulate you into giving information. Techniques involved
in social engineering attacks include consensus, scarcity, and
familiarity. There is a slight chance that all computers could
have a backdoor, but that is very unlikely, and attackers
normally don’t manually log into each machine to do a DDoS—it
would be automated, as through a bot.
■
12. C. There are many indicators of compromise (IoCs), including
unusual outbound network traffic, geographical irregularities
like logins from a country where the person normally does not
work, or increases in database read volumes beyond normal
traffic patterns. Predictive analysis is analysis work done using
datasets to attempt to determine trends and likely attack vectors
so that analysts can focus their efforts where they will be most
needed and effective. OSINT is open source intelligence, and
threat maps are often real-time or near real-time visualizations
of where threats are coming from and where they are headed to.
Use the following scenario for questions 13–15.
Chris has recently deployed a security information and event
management (SIEM) device and wants to use it effectively in his
organization. He knows that SIEM systems have a broad range
of capabilities and wants to use the features to solve problems
that he knows his organization faces. In each of the following
questions, identify the most appropriate SIEM capability or
technique to accomplish what Chris needs to do for his
organization.
■
13. B. When troubleshooting TCP handshakes, the most valuable
tool in many cases is packet capture. If Chris sees a series of SYN
packets without the handshake being completed, he can be
reasonably sure the firewall is blocking traffic. Reviewing
reports or logs may be useful for this as well but won’t show the
TCP handshake issue mentioned in the problem, and sentiment
analysis is focused on how individuals and groups are
responding, not on a technical problem.
■
14. D. User behavior analysis is a key capability when attempting
to detect potential insider threats. Chris can use his SIEM’s
behavioral analysis capabilities to detect improper or illicit use
of rights and privileges as well as abnormal behavior on the part
of his users. Sentiment analysis helps analyze feelings, and log
aggregation and security monitoring provide ways to gain
insight into the overall security posture and status of the
organization.
■
15. A. Using log aggregation to pull together logs from multiple
sources, and performing collection and initial analysis on log
collectors can help centralize and handle large log volumes.
Capturing packets is useful for network traffic analysis to
identify issues or security concerns. Security monitoring is an
overall function for security information and event management
(SIEM) and doesn’t specifically help with this need. Both
sentiment analysis and user behavior analysis are aimed at users
and groups rather than at how data is collected and managed.
■
16. B. White teams act as judges and observers during
cybersecurity exercises. Blue teams act as defenders, red teams
act as attackers, and purple teams are composed of both blue
and red team members to combine attack and defense
knowledge to improve organizational security.
■
17. A. The simplest way to ensure that APIs are only used by
legitimate users is to require the use of authentication. API keys
are one of the most frequently used methods for this. If an API
key is lost or stolen, the key can be invalidated and reissued, and
since API keys can be matched to usage, Cynthia’s company can
also bill customers based on their usage patterns if they want to.
A firewall or IP restrictions may be able to help, but they can be
fragile; customer IP addresses may change. An intrusion
prevention system (IPS) can detect and prevent attacks, but
legitimate usage would be hard to tell from those who are not
customers using an IPS.
■
18. B. Buffer overflow attacks cram more data into a field or buffer
than they can accept, overflowing into other memory locations
and either crashing the system or application, or potentially
allowing code to be inserted into executable locations.
Bluesnarfing and bluejacking are both Bluetooth attacks. Crosssite
scripting attacks allow attackers to inject scripts into pages
viewed by other users.
■
19. A. Attackers are attempting to influence Gurvinder with a
combination of scarcity and urgency. Thus, for this question you
should answer scarcity since urgency is not listed. In many
social engineering principle questions, more than one of the
principles may be in play, and you will need to answer with the
principle that is correct or more correct for the question. In this
case, there is no intimidation or claim to authority, and
consensus would require some form of validation from others.
■
20. A. Vulnerability scans use automated tools to look for known
vulnerabilities in systems and applications and then provide
reports to assist in remediation activities. Penetration tests seek
to actually exploit the vulnerabilities and break into systems.
Security audits usually focus on checking policies, incident
reports, and other documents. Security test is a generic term for
any sort of test.
■
21. C. Username complexity has no impact in credential
harvesting. Multifactor authentication can help prevent
successful credential harvesting by ensuring that even capture of
username and password is not enough to compromise the
account. Awareness training helps to reduce the likelihood of
credential exposure, and limiting or preventing use of thirdparty
web scripts makes websites less likely to have credentials
stolen through the use of those scripts, plug-ins, or modules.
■
22. C. Greg can clone a legitimate Media Access Control (MAC)
address if he can identify one on the network. This can be as
easy as checking for a MAC label on some devices or by
capturing traffic on the network if he can physically access it.
■
23. A. From the description it appears that they are not connecting
to the real web server but rather a fake server. That indicates
typo squatting: have a URL that is named very similarly to a real
site so that when users mistype the real site’s URL they will go to
the fake site.
Options B, C, and D are all incorrect. These are all methods of
attacking a website, but in this case, the actual website was not
attacked. Instead, some users are visiting a fake site.
■
24. C. Domain hijacking, or domain theft, occurs when the
registration or other information for the domain is changed
without the original registrant’s permission. This may occur
because of a compromised account or due to a breach of the
domain registrar’s security. A common issue is a lapsed domain
being purchased by a third party, and this can look like a
hijacked domain, but it is a legitimate occurrence if the domain
is not renewed! DNS hijacking inserts false information into a
DNS server, on-path (man-in-the-middle) attacks capture or
modify traffic by causing the traffic to pass through a
compromised midpoint, and zero-day attacks are attacks that
use an unknown until used vulnerability.
■
25. D. The term for low-skilled hackers is script kiddie. Script
kiddies typically use prebuilt tools and do not have the expertise
to make or modify their own tools. Nothing indicates this is
being done for ideological reasons, and thus that a hacktivist is
involved. Although “Amateur” may be an appropriate
description, the correct term is script kiddie. Finally, nothing in
this scenario indicates an insider threat.
■
26. B. Phishing is intended to acquire data, most often credentials
or other information that will be useful to the attacker. Spam is a
broader term for unwanted email, although the term is often
generally used to describe unwanted communications. Spear
phishing targets specific individuals, whereas whaling targets
important people in an organization. Smishing is sent via SMS
(text message). Malware can be sent in any of these instances,
but there is not a specific related term that means “spam with
malware in it.”
■
27. B. A collection of computers that are compromised, then
centrally controlled to perform actions like denial-of-service
attacks, data collection, and other malicious activities is called a
botnet. Zombienets, Nullnets, and Attacknets are not commonly
used terms to describe botnets.
■
28. B. Systems and software that no longer have vendor support
can be a significant security risk, and ensuring that a vendor will
continue to exist and provide support is an important part of
many procurement processes. Selah’s questions are intended to
assess the longevity and viability of the company and whether
buying from them will result in her organization having a usable
product for the long term.
■
29. B. Passive reconnaissance is any reconnaissance that is done
without actually connecting to the target. In this case, John is
conducting a form of OSINT, or open source intelligence, by
using commonly available third-party information sources to
gather information about his target. Active reconnaissance
involves communicating with the target network, such as doing
a port scan. The initial exploitation is not information gathering;
it is actually breaking into the target network. A pivot is when
you have breached one system and use that to move to another
system.
■
30. A. Server-side request forgery (SSRF) attempts typically
attempt to get HTTP data passed through and will not include
SQL injection. Blocking sensitive hostnames, IP addresses, and
URLs are all valid ways to prevent SSRF, as is the use of
whitelist-based input filters.
■
31. A. Domain Name System (DNS) poisoning attacks attempt to
insert incorrect or malicious entries into a trusted DNS server.
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning involves altering
the MAC-IP tables in a switch. Although cross-site scripting
(XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) are both
types of attacks, neither is a poisoning attack.
■
32. C. An unknown environment test is also called black-box or a
zero-knowledge test because it does not provide information
beyond the basic information needed to identify the target. A
known environment, or white-box test, involves very complete
information being given to the tester. This scenario is probably
done from outside the network, but external test is not the
correct terminology. Threat test is not a term used in
penetration testing.
■
33. D. A pivot occurs when you exploit one machine and use that as
a basis to attack other systems. Pivoting can be done from
internal or external tests. White- and black-box testing describes
the amount of information the tester is given in advance, not
how the tester performs the test.
■
34. A. Shimming is when the attacker places some malware
between an application and some other file and intercepts the
communication to that file (usually to a library or system API).
In many cases, this is done with a driver for a hardware
component. A Trojan horse might be used to get the shim onto
the system, but that is not described in this scenario. A backdoor
is a means to circumvent system authorization and get direct
access to the system. Refactoring is the process of changing
names of variables, functions, and so forth in a program.
■
35. C. SOAR is a relatively new category as defined by Gartner.
Security orchestration, automation, and response includes
threat and vulnerability management, security incident
response, and security operations automation, but not
automated malware analysis.
■
36. C. Domain reputation services like Reputation Authority,
Cisco’s Talos, McAfee’s trustedsource.org, and Barracuda’s
barracudacentral.org sites all provide domain reputation data
that allow you to look up a domain or IP address to determine if
it is currently blacklisted or has a poor reputation.
■
37. B. His machines are part of a distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attack. This scenario describes a generic DDoS, not a
specific one like SYN flood, which would involve many SYN
packets being sent without a full three-way TCP handshake.
These machines could be part of a botnet or they may just have a
trigger that causes them to launch the attack at a specific time.
The real key in this scenario is the DDoS attack. Finally, a
backdoor gives an attacker access to the target system.
■
38. B. Since open Wi-Fi hotspots do not have a way to prove they
are legitimate, they can be easily spoofed. Attackers can stand
up a fake version of the hotspot and then conduct an SSL
stripping attack by inserting themselves into sessions that
victims attempt to open to secure servers.
■
39. B. A Trojan horse attaches a malicious program to a legitimate
program. When the user downloads and installs the legitimate
program, they get the malware. A logic bomb is malware that
does its misdeeds when some condition is met. A rootkit is
malware that gets administrative, or root, access. A macro virus
is a virus that is embedded in a document as a macro.
■
40. D. Whaling is targeting a specific individual who is important
in the organization like the president or chief financial officer
(CFO). Spear phishing targets specific individuals or groups, but
whaling is more specific in terms of the importance of the
individuals involved. Targeted phishing is not a term used in the
industry. Phishing is the generic term for a wide range of related
attacks, and you should choose the most accurate answer for
questions like this.
■
41. D. Criminal syndicates may produce, sell, and support malware
tools, or may deploy them themselves. Crypto malware and
other packages are examples of tools often created and used by
criminal syndicates. State actors are more likely to be associated
with advanced persistent threats (APTs) aimed at accomplishing
goals of the nation-state that supports them. Hacktivists
typically have political motivations, whereas script kiddies may
simply be in it for recognition or fun.
■
42. A. A rainbow table is a table of precomputed hashes, used to
retrieve passwords. A backdoor is used to gain access to a
system, not to recover passwords. Social engineering and
dictionary attacks can both be used to gain access to passwords,
but they are not tables of precomputed hashes.
■
43. B. The most common concern that will arise when a vendor no
longer supports a device is a lack of updates or patches. This is
particularly concerning when the devices are operational
technology such as utility, lighting, or other infrastructure
control devices that have a very long life cycle and control
important processes or systems. Although improper data
storage, lack of documentation, and configuration issues can all
be issues, lack of updates and patching remains the biggest and
most frequent issue.
■
44. A. Bluejacking involves sending unsolicited messages to
Bluetooth devices when they are in range. Bluesnarfing involves
getting data from the Bluetooth device. An evil twin attack uses a
rogue access point whose name is similar or identical to that of a
legitimate access point.
■
45. A. Since Dennis is able to view the web traffic before it is sent
to the actual server, he should be able to conduct a plain-text
password attack by intercepting the password. Pass-the-hash
attacks are typically used inside Windows environments, SQL
injection would attack the server, and cross-site scripting is
possible but not as likely as the plain-text password attack in
this scenario.
■
46. A. Dumpster diving is the term for rummaging through the
waste/trash to recover useful documents or materials.
Penetration testers and attackers may dumpster-dive as part of
their efforts. In fact, emptying trash cans in a location can
provide useful information even without jumping into a
dumpster! Trash diving and trash engineering are not the terms
used in the industry. Nothing in this scenario describes social
engineering.
■
47. A. This is a remote-access Trojan (RAT), malware that opens
access for someone to remotely access the system. A worm
would have spread itself via a vulnerability, whereas a logic
bomb runs when some logical condition is met. Finally, a rootkit
provides root or administrative access to the system.
■
48. B. Zero-day exploits are new, and they are not in the virus
definitions for the antivirus (AV) programs. This makes them
difficult to detect, except by their behavior. RATs, worms, and
rootkits are more likely to be detected by AV programs.
■
49. D. Radio frequency identifier (RFID) attacks typically focus on
data capture, spoofing RFID data, or conducting a denial-ofservice
attack. Birthday attacks are used against cryptosystems,
which may be part of an RFID tag environment, but they aren’t a
common attack against RFID systems.
■
50. C. Initialization vectors are used with stream ciphers. An IV
attack attempts to exploit a flaw to use the IV to expose
encrypted data. Nothing in this scenario requires or describes a
rogue access point/evil twin. Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) uses
a PIN to connect to the wireless access point (WAP). The WPS
attack attempts to intercept that PIN in transmission, connect to
the WAP, and then steal the WPA2 password.
■
51. C. This description does not include any risk to availability
since there is no information about systems or services being
down or offline. This scenario would likely result in reputational,
financial, and data loss impacts for Scott’s company.
■
52. B. Cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF) sends fake
requests to a website that purport to be from a trusted,
authenticated user. Cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust
the user has for the website and embeds scripts into that
website. Bluejacking is a Bluetooth attack. Nothing in this
scenario requires or describes an evil twin, which is an attack
that uses a malicious access point that duplicates a legitimate
AP.
■
53. A. Cyberintelligence fusion is the process of gathering,
analyzing, and then distributing information between disparate
agencies and organizations. Fusion centers like those operated
by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) focus on
strengthening shared intelligence activities. They are not
specifically tasked with building tools by combining other tools,
although they may in some cases. They are not power plants,
and they are focused on gathering and sharing information, not
building a classification structure.
■
54. B. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list has
entries that describe and provide references to publicly known
cybersecurity vulnerabilities. A CVE feed will provide updated
information about new vulnerabilities and a useful index
number to cross reference with other services.
■
55. B. A birthday attack exploits the birthday problem in
probability theory and relies on finding collisions between
random attack attempts and the number of potential
permutations of a solution. Birthday attacks are one method of
attacking cryptographic hash functions. They are not a social
engineering attack, a network denial-of-service attack, or a
TCP/IP protocol attack.
■
56. B. This an example of a disassociation attack. The
deauthentication packet causes Juanita’s system to disassociate,
and the attacker can then execute a second attack targeting her
authentication credentials or other wireless data using an evil
twin attack. Misconfiguration won’t cause authenticated users to
deauthenticate. Session hijacking involves taking over an
authenticated session. Backdoors are built-in methods to
circumvent authentication.
■
57. A. Dictionary attacks use a list of words that are believed to be
likely passwords. A rainbow table is a precomputed table of
hashes. Brute force tries every possible random combination. If
an attacker has the original plain text and ciphertext for a
message, they can determine the key space used through bruteforce
attempts targeting the key space. Session hijacking is when
the attacker takes over an authenticated session.
■
58. B. Downgrade attacks seek to make a Transport Layer Security
(TLS) connection use a weaker cipher version, thus allowing the
attacker to more easily break the encryption and read the
protected data. In a disassociation attack, the attacker attempts
to force the victim into disassociating from a resource. Session
hijacking is when the attacker takes over an authenticated
session. Brute-force attempts every possible random
combination to get the password or encryption key.
■
59. D. A collision is when two different inputs produce the same
hash. A rainbow table is a table of precomputed hashes. Brute
force attempts every possible random combination to get the
password or encryption key. Session hijacking is when the
attacker takes over an authenticated session.
■
60. C. An advanced persistent threat (APT) involves sophisticated
(i.e., advanced) attacks over a period of time (i.e., persistent). A
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) could be a part of an APT,
but in and of itself is unlikely to be an APT. Brute force attempts
every possible random combination to get the password or
encryption key. In a disassociation attack, the attacker attempts
to force the victim into disassociating from a resource.
■
61. B. Phishing is not commonly used to acquire email addresses.
Phishing emails target personal information and sensitive
information like passwords and credit card numbers in most
cases.
■
62. A. When an IDS or antivirus mistakes legitimate traffic for an
attack, this is called a false positive. A false negative is when the
IDS mistakes an attack for legitimate traffic. It is the opposite of
a false positive. Options C and D are both incorrect. Although
these may be grammatically correct, these are not the terms
used in the industry. In military operations, false flag operations
attempt to transfer blame to another company, thus a “false
flag.”
■
63. B. A keylogger is a software or hardware tool used to capture
keystrokes. Keyloggers are often used by attackers to capture
credentials and other sensitive information. A rootkit is used to
obtain and maintain administrative rights on a system, and a
worm is a self-spreading form of malware that frequently targets
vulnerable services on a network to spread.
■
64. A. The term for attempting to gain any privileges beyond what
you have is privilege escalation. Session hijacking is taking over
an authenticated session. Root grabbing and climbing are not
terms used in the industry.
■
65. B. MAC flooding attacks attempt to overflow a switch’s CAM
table, causing the switch to send all traffic to all ports rather
than to the port that a given MAC address is associated with.
Although this was possible with many older switches, most
modern switches are less susceptible to this type of attack, and
some have security capabilities built in to prevent this type of
attack.
■
66. B. Spyware and adware are both common examples PUPs, or
potentially unwanted programs. Though not directly malicious,
they can pose risks to user privacy as well as create annoyances
like popups or other unwanted behaviors. Trojans appear to be
legitimate programs or are paired with them, RATs provide
remote access and are a subcategory of Trojans, and
ransomware demands payment or other actions to avoid
damage to files or reputation.
■
67. C. A race condition can occur when multiple threads in an
application are using the same variable and the situation is not
properly handled. Option A is incorrect. A buffer overflow is
attempting to put more data in a buffer than it is designed to
hold. Option B is incorrect. A logic bomb is malware that
performs its misdeed when some logical condition is met.
Option D is incorrect. As the name suggests, improper error
handling is the lack of adequate or appropriate error handling
mechanisms within software.
■
68. B. The malware in this example is a Trojan horse—it pretends
to be something desirable, or at least innocuous, and installs
malicious software in addition to or instead of the desired
software. A rootkit gives root or administrative access, spyware
is malware that records user activities, and a boot sector virus is
a virus that infects the boot sector of the hard drive.
■
69. B. The Postgres server is set up using a weak password for the
user postgres, the administrative login for the database. This is a
form of unsecured administrative or root account. Interestingly,
this is not a default setting, since Postgres uses no password by
default for the Postgres account—an even worse setting than
using postgres as the password, but not by much!
■
70. A. Annie has moved laterally. Lateral movement moves to
systems at the same trust level. This can provide access to new
data or different views of the network depending on how the
systems and security are configured. Privilege escalation
involves gaining additional privileges, often those of an
administrative user. Vertical movement is sometimes referenced
when gaining access to systems or accounts with a higher
security or trust level. Privilege retention was made up for this
question.
■
71. A. This is an example of a false positive. A false positive can
cause a vulnerability to show that was not actually there. This
sometimes happens when a patch or fix is installed but the
application does not change in a way that shows the change, and
it has been an issue with updates where the version number is
the primary check for a vulnerability. When a vulnerability
scanner sees a vulnerable version number but a patch has been
installed that does not update it, a false positive report can
occur. A false negative would report a patch or fix where there
was actually a vulnerability. Automatic updates were not
mentioned, nor was a specific Apache version.
■
72. C. A buffer overflow is possible when boundaries are not
checked and the attacker tries to put in more data than the
variable can hold. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web page
attack. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a web page attack. A
logic bomb is malware that performs its misdeed when some
condition is met.
■
73. C. Consensus, sometimes called social proof, is a social
engineering principle that leverages the fact that people are
often willing to trust groups of other people. Here, the attackers
have planted false information that the software is trustworthy,
thus allowing targets to “prove” to themselves that they can
safely install the software. Scarcity uses a perception that
something may not be available or is uncommon and thus
desirable. Familiarity takes advantage of the trust that
individuals put into people and organizations they are already
familiar with. Trust-based attacks exploit a perception of
trustworthiness.
■
74. B. A logic bomb performs malicious actions when a specific
condition or conditions are met. A boot sector virus infects the
boot sector of the hard drive. A buffer overflow occurs when the
attacker attempts to put more data in a variable than it can hold.
A sparse infector virus performs its malicious activity
intermittently to make it harder to detect.
■
75. B. Elicitation, or the process of eliciting information through
conversation to gather useful information, is a key tool in a
penetration tester’s social engineering arsenal. Pretexting
involves the use of believable reasons for the target to go along
with whatever the social engineering is attempting to do.
Impersonation involves acting like someone you are not,
whereas intimidation attempts to scare or threaten the target
into doing what the social engineer wants them to.
■
76. B. All of these protocols are unsecure. FTP has been replaced
by secure versions in some uses (SFTP/FTPS), whereas Telnet
has been superseded by SSH in modern applications. RSH is
outmoded and should be seen only on truly ancient systems. If
you find a system or device exposing these protocols, you will
need to dig in further to determine why they are exposed and
how they can be protected if they must remain open for a
legitimate reason.
■
77. B. The best way for Scott to determine where an organization’s
wireless networks can be accessed from is to use war driving,
war flying, and/or war walking techniques to map out the
wireless signal footprint of the organization. OSINT and active
scans would be useful gathering information about the
organization and its systems, but not about its wireless networks
range and accessibility, and social engineering is more likely to
be useful for gathering information or gaining access to facilities
or systems.
■
78. A. A macro virus is a malicious script (macro) embedded into a
file, typically a Microsoft Office file. They are typically written in
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) script. A boot sector virus
infects the boot sector of the hard drive. A Trojan horse is
malware that is tied to a legitimate program. In this scenario,
the malware is actually embedded in an Office document. The
two are similar, but not the same. A remote access Trojan (RAT)
is a Trojan horse that gives the attacker remote access to the
machine.
■
79. C. By giving the tester logins, you are allowing them to conduct
a credentialed scan (i.e., a scan with an account or accounts that
allow them access to check settings and configurations). Known
environment and partially known environment tests describe
the level of knowledge the tester is given of the network. A
privilege scan cannot be an unknown environment test, but it
could be either known or partially known. An intrusive scan is a
term used for scans that attempt to exercise or use the
vulnerability they find instead of attempting to avoid harm.
■
80. B. The Security+ exam expects practitioners to be able to
analyze scripts and code to determine roughly what function
they perform and to be able to identify multiple programming
languages. Python relies on formatting like indenting to indicate
blocks of code and does not use line end indicators as you would
find in some languages. This code is a basic Python port scanner
that will scan every port from 1 to 9999, checking to see if it
allows a connection.
■
81. C. Botnets are often used to launch DDoS attacks, with the
attack coming from all the computers in the botnet
simultaneously. Phishing attacks attempt to get the user to give
up information, click on a link, or open an attachment. Adware
consists of unwanted pop-up ads. A Trojan horse attaches
malware to a legitimate program.
■
82. B. Amanda has discovered an insider threat. Insider threats can
be difficult to discover, as a malicious administrator or other
privileged user will often have the ability to conceal their actions
or may actually be the person tasked with hunting for threats
like this! This is not a zero-day—no vulnerability was mentioned,
there was no misconfiguration since this was an intentional
action, and encryption is not mentioned or discussed.
■
83. B. Social media influence campaigns seek to achieve the goals
of the attacker or owner of the campaign. They leverage social
media using bots and groups of posters to support the ideas,
concepts, or beliefs that align with the goals of the campaign.
Impersonation is a type of social engineering attack where the
attacker pretends to be someone else. A watering hole attack
places malware or malicious code on a site or sites that are
frequently visited by a targeted group. Asymmetric warfare is
warfare between groups with significantly different power or
capabilities.
■
84. C. Using default settings is a form of weak configuration. Many
vulnerability scanners and attack tools have default settings
built-in to test with, and default settings are easily obtained for
most devices with a quick search of the Internet. Configuring the
accounts is not the issue; changing default passwords and
settings is. Although training users is important, that’s not the
issue in this scenario. Patching systems is important, but that
won’t change default settings.
■
85. D. In a DLL injection, the malware attempts to inject code into
the process of some library. This is a rather advanced attack.
Option A is incorrect. A logic bomb executes its misdeed when
some condition is met. Option B is incorrect. Session hijacking is
taking over an authenticated session. Option C is incorrect.
Buffer overflows are done by sending more data to a variable
than it can hold.
■
86. B. State actors (or nation-state actors) often have greater
resources and skills, making them a more significant threat and
far more likely to be associated with an advanced persistent
threat actor. Script kiddies, hacktivists, and insider threats tend
to be less capable and are all far less likely to be associated with
an APT.
■
87. C. An intrusive scan attempts to actively exploit vulnerabilities,
and thus could possibly cause some disruption of operations.
For this reason, it should be conducted outside normal business
hours or in a test environment, if it is used at all. A nonintrusive
scan attempts to identify vulnerabilities without exploiting
them. A penetration test actually attempts to breach the network
by exploiting vulnerabilities. An audit is primarily a document
check. Both intrusive and nonintrusive vulnerability scans can
be effective at finding vulnerabilities.
■
88. C. A backdoor is a method for bypassing normal security and
directly accessing the system. A logic bomb is malware that
performs its misdeeds when some condition is met. A Trojan
horse wraps a malicious program to a legitimate program. When
the user downloads and installs the legitimate program, they get
the malware. A rootkit is malware that gets root or
administrative privileges.
■
89. D. The fact that the website is defaced in a manner related to
the company’s public indicates that the attackers were most
likely engaging in hacktivism to make a political or belief-based
point. Scripts, nation-state actors, and organized crime don’t
account for the statements adverse to the company’s policies,
which is why hacktivism is the real cause.
■
90. A. Pharming attempts to redirect traffic intended for a
legitimate site to another malicious site. Attackers most often do
this by changing the local hosts file or by exploiting a trusted
DNS server.
■
91. B. Password spraying is a specific type of brute force attack
which uses a smaller list of common passwords for many
accounts to attempt to log in. Although brute forcing is
technically correct, the best match here is password spraying.
When you encounter questions like this on the test, make sure
you provide the most accurate answer, rather than one that fits
but may not be the best answer. Limited login attacks is a madeup
answer, and spinning an account refers to changing the
password for an account, often because of a compromise or to
prevent a user from logging back into it while preserving the
account.
■
92. C. Although you might suppose that a nation-state attacker (the
usual attacker behind an advanced persistent threat) would
attack from a foreign IP address, they often use a compromised
address in the target country as a base for attacks. Options A, B,
and D are all incorrect. These are actually signs of an advanced
persistent threat.
■
93. B. A privilege escalation attack can occur horizontally, where
attackers obtain similar levels of privilege but for other users, or
vertically where they obtain more advanced rights. In this case,
Charles has discovered a vertical privilege escalation attack that
has allowed the attacker to obtain administrative rights. Crosssite
scripting and SQL injection are both common types of web
application attacks, and a race condition occurs when data can
be changed between when it is checked and when it is used.
■
94. A. Evil twin attacks use a malicious access point configured to
appear to be identical to a legitimate AP. Attackers wait for their
targets to connect via the evil twin, and can then capture or
modify traffic however they wish. IP spoofing uses the IP
address of a system already on the network, Trojan horses are
malware that appear to be legitimate software or files, and
privilege escalation is the process of using exploits to gain higher
privileges.
■
95. A. A zero-day exploit or attack occurs before the vendor has
knowledge of it. The remainder of the answers don’t accurately
describe a zero-day attack—just because it has not yet been
breached does not make it a zero-day, nor is a zero-day
necessarily quickly exploitable. Finally, a zero-day attack does
not specify how long the attacker may have access.
■
96. D. Prepending is one of the stranger terms that appear on the
CompTIA Security+ exam and is not a commonly used phrase in
the industry. Thus, you need to know that when it is used for
this exam it can mean one of three things: adding an expression
or phrase to an email, subject line, or headers to either protect
or fool users. They also note that it can be used when adding
data as part of an attack, and that social engineers may
“prepend” information by inserting it into conversation to get
targets to think about things the attacker wants them to.
Pretexing is a social engineering technique where attackers use a
reason that is intended to be believable to the target for what
they are doing. SQL injection is attempts to add SQL code to a
web query to gain additional access or data. Prepending is used
to cover a wide variety of techniques in the Security+ exam
outline that focus on adding information or data to existing
content.
■
97. D. Although auditing some libraries or libraries that are
custom-developed for the code is common, auditing all libraries
used in the code is unlikely except in exceptional situations. The
remainder of these practices are all commonly used when
working with outsourced code development teams.
■
98. C. DNS poisoning occurs when false DNS information is
inserted into legitimate DNS servers, resulting in traffic being
redirected to unwanted or malicious sites. A backdoor provides
access to the system by circumventing normal authentication.
An APT is an advanced persistent threat. A Trojan horse ties a
malicious program to a legitimate program.
■
99. C. Spyware and adware are both common examples of a PUP,
or potentially unwanted program. A CAT was made up for this
question and is not a common categorization for malware,
whereas worms are self-spreading malware that often exploit
vulnerabilities to spread via a network. Trojans pretend to be
legitimate software or paired with legitimate software to gain
entry to a system or device.
■
100. B. A Trojan horse pretends to be legitimate software, and may
even include it, but also includes malicious software as well.
Backdoors, RATs, and polymorphic viruses are all attacks, but
they do not match what is described in the question scenario.
■
101. A. A remote access Trojan (RAT) is malware that gives the
attacker remote access to the victim machine. Macro viruses
operate inside of Microsoft Office files. Although a backdoor will
give access, it is usually something in the system put there by
programmers, not introduced by malware. A RAT is a type of
Trojan horse, but a Trojan horse is more general than what is
described in the scenario. When you encounter questions like
this on the exam, you will need to select the best answer, not just
one that may answer the question!
■
102. B. Card cloning often occurs after a skimming attack is used to
capture card data, whether from credit cards or entry access
cards. Brute-force and rainbow table-based attacks are both
used against passwords, whereas a birthday attack is a
cryptographic attack often aimed at finding two messages that
hash to the same value.
■
103. B. Cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF) sends forged
requests to a website, supposedly from a trusted user. Cross-site
scripting (XSS) is the injection of scripts into a website to exploit
the users. A buffer overflow tries to put more data in a variable
than the variable can hold. A remote-access Trojan (RAT) is
malware that gives the attacker access to the system.
■
104. A. A denial-of-service (DoS) attack may target a memory leak.
If an attacker can induce the web application to generate the
memory leak, then eventually the web application will consume
all memory on the web server and the web server will crash.
Backdoors are not caused by memory leaks. SQL injection places
malformed SQL into text boxes. A buffer overflow attempts to
put more data in a variable than it can hold.
■
105. D. This is an example of an application distributed denial-ofservice
(DDoS) attack, aimed at a gaming application. A network
DDoS would be aimed at network technology, either the devices
or protocols that underly networks. An operational technology
(OT) DDoS targets SCADA, ICS, utility or similar operational
systems. A GDoS was made up for this question.
■
106. D. Purple teams are a combination of red and blue teams
intended to leverage the techniques and tools from both sides to
improve organizational security. A red team is a team that tests
security by using tools and techniques like an actual attacker. A
blue team is a defender team that protects against attackers (and
testers like red teams!). White teams oversee cybersecurity
contests and judge events between red teams and blue teams.
■
107. B. This is an example of ransomware, which demands payment
to return your data. A rootkit provides access to
administrator/root privileges. A logic bomb executes its
malicious activity when some condition is met. This scenario
does not describe whaling.
■
108. D. If access is not handled properly, a time of check/time of use
condition can exist where the memory is checked, changed, then
used. Memory leaks occur when memory is allocated but not
deallocated. A buffer overflow is when more data is put into a
variable than it can hold. An integer overflow occurs when an
attempt is made to put an integer that is too large into a
variable, such as trying to put a 64-bit integer into a 32-bit
variable.
■
109. B. Near-field communication (NFC) is susceptible to an
attacker eavesdropping on the signal. Tailgating is a physical
attack and not affected by NFC technology. Both IP spoofing and
race conditions are unrelated to NFC technology.
■
110. B. Fileless viruses often take advantage of PowerShell to
perform actions once they have used a vulnerability in a browser
or browser plug-in to inject themselves into system memory.
Rick’s best option from the list provided is to enable PowerShell
logging and then to review the logs on systems he believes are
infected. Since fileless viruses don’t use files, an image of the
disk is unlikely to provide much useful data. Disabling the
administrative user won’t have an impact, since the compromise
will happen inside the account of whichever user is logged in
and impacted by the malware. Crash dump files could have
artifacts of the fileless virus if the machine crashed while it was
active, but unless that occurs they will not have that
information.
■
111. B. Tailgating involves simply following a legitimate user
through the door once they have opened it, and it is a common
means of exploiting a smartcard-based entry access system. It is
simpler and usually easier than attempting to capture and clone
a card. Phishing is unrelated to physical security. Although it is
possible to generate a fake smartcard, it is a very uncommon
attack. RFID spoofing can be accomplished but requires access
to a valid RFID card and is relatively uncommon as well.
■
112. B. Adam should look for one or more threat feeds that match
the type of information he is looking for. Open threat feeds exist
that typically use STIX and TAXII to encode and transfer feed
data to multiple tools in an open format. None of the other feed
types here would meet Adam’s needs.
■
113. B. Malicious tools like BadUSB can make a USB cable or drive
look like a keyboard when they are plugged in. Somewhat
strangely, the Security+ exam outline focuses on malicious USB
cables, but you should be aware that malicious thumb drives are
far more common and have been used by penetration testers
simply by dropping them in a parking lot near their intended
target. A Trojan or a worm is a possibility, but the clue involving
the keyboard would point to a USB device as the first place
Naomi should look.
■
114. D. Using a pass-the-hash attack requires attackers to acquire a
legitimate hash, and then present it to a server or service. A real
hash was provided; it was not spoofed. An evil twin is a wireless
attack. Shimming is inserting malicious code between an
application and a library.
■
115. B. Claiming to be from tech support is claiming authority, and
the story the caller gave indicates urgency. Yes, this caller used
urgency (the virus spread) but did not attempt intimidation.
Authority and trust are closely related, and in this case urgency
was the second major factor. This caller used urgency but not
intimidation.
■
116. B. The questions tells us that these are Windows 10 systems, a
current operating system. From there, it is safe to presume that
something has gone wrong with the patching process or that
there isn’t a patching process. Elaine should investigate both
what the process is and if there are specific reasons the systems
are not patched. Since we know these systems run a current OS,
option A, unsupported operating systems, can be ruled out. The
vulnerabilities are specifically noted to be Windows
vulnerabilities, ruling out option C, and there is no mention of
protocols, eliminating option D as well.
■
117. A. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning, often called
ARP spoofing, occurs when an attacker sends malicious ARP
packets to the default gateway of a local area network, causing it
to change the mappings it maintains between hardware (MAC)
addresses and IP addresses. In DNS poisoning, domain name to
IP address entries in a DNS server are altered. This attack did
not involve an on-path attack. A backdoor provides access to the
attacker, which circumvents normal authentication.
■
118. A. In a known environment (white-box) test, the tester is given
extensive knowledge of the target network. Full disclosure is not
a term used to describe testing. Unknown environment (blackbox)
testing involves only very minimal information being given
to the tester. A red team test simulates a particular type of
attacker, such as a nation-state attacker, an insider, or other
type of attacker.
■
119. C. Social engineering is about using people skills to get
information you would not otherwise have access to. Illegal
copying of software isn’t social engineering, nor is gathering of
discarded manuals and printouts, which describes dumpster
diving. Phishing emails use some social engineering, but that is
one example of social engineering, not a definition.
■
120. C. Shoulder surfing involves literally looking over someone’s
shoulder in a public place and gathering information, perhaps
login passwords. ARP poisoning alters the Address Resolution
Protocol tables in the switch. Phishing is an attempt to gather
information, often via email, or to convince a user to click a link
to, and/or download, an attachment. A Smurf attack is a
historical form of denial-of-service attack.
■
121. A. Invoice scams typically either send legitimate appearing
invoices to trick an organization into paying the fake invoice, or
they focus on tricking employees into logging into a fake site to
allow the acquisition of credentials. They typically do not focus
on delivery of malware or stealing cryptocurrency.
■
122. B. Vulnerability scans use automated and semiautomated
processes to identify known vulnerabilities. Audits usually
involve document checks. Unknown and known environment
testing are both types of penetration tests.
■
123. A. A partially known (gray-box) test involves the tester being
given partial information about the network. A known
environment (white-box) test involves the tester being given full
or nearly full information about the target network, and
unknown (black-box) environments don’t provide information
about the target environment. Masked is not a testing term.
■
124. D. In the on-path (man-in-the-middle) attack, the attacker is
between the client and the server, and to either end, the attacker
appears like the legitimate other end. This does not describe any
denial-of-service attack. A replay attack involves resending login
information. Although an on-path attack can be used to perform
eavesdropping, in this scenario the best answer is an on-path
attack.
■
125. A. In a man-in-the-browser attack, the malware intercepts calls
from the browser to the system, such as system libraries. Onpath
attack involves having some process between the two ends
of communication in order to compromise passwords or
cryptography keys. In a buffer overflow attack, more data is put
into a variable than the variable was intended to hold. Session
hijacking involves taking over an authenticated session.
■
126. B. Uniform resource locator (URL) redirection is frequently
used in web applications to direct users to another service or
portion of the site. If this redirection is not properly secured, it
can be used to redirect to an arbitrary untrusted or malicious
site. This issue, known as Open Redirect vulnerabilities, remains
quite common. The code shown does not contain SQL or LDAP
code, and there is no mention of changing DNS information on
the server, thus making the other options incorrect.
■
127. D. Placing a larger integer value into a smaller integer variable
is an integer overflow. Memory overflow is not a term used, and
memory leak is about allocating memory and not deallocating it.
Buffer overflows often involve arrays. Variable overflow is not a
term used in the industry.
■
128. B. Cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF) takes advantage
of the cookies and URL parameters legitimate sites use to help
track and serve their visitors. In an XSRF or a CSRF attack,
attackers leverage authorized, authenticated users’ rights by
providing them with a cookie or session data that will be read
and processed when they visit the target site. An attacker may
embed a link within an email or other location that will be
clicked or executed by the user or an automated process with
that user’s session already open. This is not SQL injection, which
would attempt to send commands to a database, or LDAP
injection, which gathers data from a directory server. Cross-site
scripting (XSS) would embed code in user-submittable data
fields that a website will display to other users, causing it to run.
■
129. D. You will need to be able to read and understand basic scripts
and programs in multiple languages for the Security+ exam. In
this example, you can recognize common Bash syntax and see
that it is adding a key to the authorized keys file for root. If that’s
not an expected script, you should be worried!
■
130. D. Rootkits provide administrative access to systems, thus the
“root” in rootkit. A Trojan horse combines malware with a
legitimate program. A logic bomb performs its malicious activity
when some condition is met. A multipartite virus infects the
boot sector and a file.
■
131. C. Memory leaks can cause crashes, resulting in an outage. This
targets the availability leg of the CIA (confidentiality, integrity,
and availability) triad, making it a security issue. Memory leaks
do not actually leak to other locations, nor do they allow code
injection. Instead memory leaks cause memory exhaustion or
other issues over time as memory is not properly reclaimed.
■
132. B. This question combines two pieces of knowledge: how
botnet command and control works, and that IRC’s default port
is TCP 6667. Although this could be one of the other answers,
the most likely answer given the information available is a
botnet that uses Internet Relay Chat (IRC) as its command-andcontrol
channel.
■
133. A. Software updates for consumer-grade wireless routers are
typically applied as firmware updates, and Susan should
recommend that the business owner regularly upgrade their
wireless router firmware. If updates are not available, they may
need to purchase a new router that will continue to receive
updates and configure it appropriately. This is not a default
configuration issue nor an unsecured administrative account—
neither is mentioned, nor is encryption.
■
134. B. Radio frequency identification (RFID) is commonly used for
access badges, inventory systems, and even for identifying pets
using implantable chips. In a penetration testing scenario,
attackers are most likely to attempt to acquire or clone RFIDbased
access badges to gain admittance to a building or office
suite.
■
135. B. The word you will need to know for the Security+ exam for
phishing via SMS is “smishing,” a term that combines SMS and
phishing. Bluejacking sends unsolicited messages to Bluetooth
devices, and phonejacking and text whaling were made up for
this question.
■
136. B. This is vishing, or using voice calls for phishing. Spear
phishing is targeting a small, specific group. War dialing is
dialing numbers hoping a computer modem answers.
Robocalling is used to place unsolicited telemarketing calls.
■
137. A. Worms spread themselves via vulnerabilities, making this an
example of a worm. A virus is software that self-replicates. A
logic bomb executes its malicious activity when some condition
is met. A Trojan horse combines malware with a legitimate
program.
■
138. B. Dumpster diving is the process of going through the trash to
find documents. Shredding documents will help to prevent
dumpster diving, but truly dedicated dumpster divers can
reassemble even well-shredded documents, leading some
organizations to burn their most sensitive documents after they
have been shredded. Phishing is often done via email or phone
and is an attempt to elicit information or convince a user to click
a link or open an attachment. Shoulder surfing is literally
looking over someone’s shoulder. In the on-path (man-in-themiddle)
attack, the attacker is between the client and the server,
and to either end, the attacker appears like the legitimate other
end.
■
139. B. Systems should not have a rootkit on them when a
penetration test starts, and rootkits installed during the test
should be fully removed and securely deleted. The rest of the
options are all typical parts of a penetration testing cleanup
process. You can read more at the penetration testing standard
site at www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Post_Exploitation.
■
140. C. This is an example of an online brute-force dictionary attack.
Dictionary attacks use common passwords as well as common
substitutions to attempt to break into a system or service. Backoff
algorithms that lock out attackers after a small number of
incorrect password attempts can help slow or stop dictionary
attacks and other brute-force password attacks. Rainbow tables
are tables of precomputed hashes. The birthday attack is a
method for generating collisions of hashes. Finally, no spoofing
is indicated in this scenario.
■
141. C. Jim has discovered a skimmer, a device used for skimming
attacks that capture credit and debit card information.
Skimmers may be able to wirelessly upload the information they
capture, or they may require attackers to retrieve data in person.
Some skimmers include cameras to capture keypresses for PINs
and other data. A replay attack would reuse credentials or other
information to act like a legitimate user, a race condition occurs
when the time of use and time of check of data can be exploited,
and a card cloner would be used after cards were skimmed to
duplicate them.
■
142. D. Active reconnaissance connects to the network using
techniques such as port scanning. Both active and passive
reconnaissance can be done manually or with tools. Black-box
and white-box refer to the amount of information the tester is
given. Attackers and testers use both types of reconnaissance.
■
143. D. Browser toolbars are sometimes examples of PUPs, or
potentially unwanted programs like spyware or adware. A worm
is a type of malware that spreads on its own by exploiting
vulnerabilities on network-connected systems. Once it infects a
system, it will typically scan for other vulnerable systems and
continue to spread. A RAT is a remote-access Trojan, and a
rootkit is used to gain and keep administrative access.
■
144. B. OSINT, or open source intelligence, is intelligence
information obtained from public sources like search engines,
websites, domain name registrars, and a host of other locations.
OPSEC, or operational security, refers to habits such as not
disclosing unnecessary information. STIX is the Structured
Threat Intelligence Exchange protocol, and IntCon was made up
for this question.
■
145. C. Watering hole attacks target groups by focusing on common
shared behaviors like visiting specific websites. If attackers can
compromise the site or deliver targeted attacks through it, they
can then target that group. Watercooler, phishing net, and phish
pond attacks were all made up for this question.
■
146. C. Although Structured Query Language (SQL) queries are
often parameterized, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) security practices focus instead on user input validation
and filtering of output to ensure that an excessive amount of
data is not being returned in queries. As with all services,
securely configuring LDAP services is one of the first protections
that should be put in place.
■
147. B. Although it may sound dramatic, sites accessible via Tor or
other tools that separate them from the rest of the Internet are
sometimes called “the dark web.” The Security+ exam uses this
term, so you need to be aware of it for the exam. The rest of the
options were made up and may be almost as silly as calling a
section of the Internet the dark web.
■
148. B. URL redirection has many legitimate uses, from redirecting
traffic from no-longer-supported links to current replacements
to URL shortening, but URL redirection was commonly used for
phishing attacks. Modern browsers display the full, real URL,
helping to limit the impact of this type of attack. Certificate
expiration tracking is used to ensure that website certificates are
current, but it does not prevent URL redirection attacks.
JavaScript being enabled or disabling cookies is not helpful for
this purpose either.
■
149. A. Vulnerabilities in cloud services require work on the part of
the cloud service provider to remediate them. You can remediate
most vulnerabilities in your own infrastructure yourself without
a third party. Vulnerabilities in cloud services and local
infrastructure can both be as severe and take as much time to
remediate. Regardless of where your organization stores its data,
your responsibility for it is likely the same!
■
150. C. Consumer wireless routers provide local administrative
access via their default credentials. Although they recommend
that you change the password (and sometimes the username for
greater security), many installations result in an unsecured
administrative account. The other answers are all common
issues but not what is described in the question.
■
151. A. A red team is a team that tests security by using tools and
techniques like an actual attacker. A blue team is a defender
team that protects against attackers (and testers like red
teams!). Purple teams are a combination of red and blue teams
intended to leverage the techniques and tools from both sides to
improve organizational security. White teams oversee
cybersecurity contests and judge events between red teams and
blue teams.
■
152. A. Directory traversal attacks attempt to exploit tools that can
read directories and files by moving through the directory
structure. The example would try to read the config.txt file
three layers above the working directory of the web application
itself. Adding common directory names or common filenames
can allow attackers (or penetration testers) to read other files in
accessible directories if they are not properly secured. The
remainder of the options were made up for this question,
although Slashdot is an actual website.
■
153. A. Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)
services are designed to integrate with a broader range of both
internal and external applications. Both security information
and event management (SIEM) and SOAR systems typically
include threat and vulnerability management tools, as well as
security operations’ automation capabilities.
■
154. A. A known environment (white-box) test involves providing
extensive information, as described in this scenario. A known
environment test could be internal or external. This scenario
describes the opposite of an unknown environment (black-box)
test, which would involve zero knowledge. Finally, threat test is
not a term used in penetration testing.
■
155. C. The Windows Security Account Manager (SAM) file and the
/etc/shadow file for Linux systems both contain passwords and
are popular targets for offline brute-force attacks.
■
156. C. An SSL stripping attack requires attackers to persuade a
victim to send traffic through them via HTTP while continuing
to send HTTPS encrypted traffic to the legitimate server by
pretending to be the victim. This is not a brute-force attack, a
Trojan attack would require malware, and a downgrade attack
would try to move the encrypted session to a less secure
encryption protocol.
■
157. C. The U.S. Trusted Foundry program is intended to prevent
supply chain attacks by ensuring end-to-end supply chain
security for important integrated circuits and electronics.
■
158. B. Threat maps like those found at threatmap.fortiguard.com
and threatmap.checkpoint.com are visualizations of real-time or
near real-time data gathered by vendors and other organizations
that can help visualize major threats and aid in analysis of them.
Pie charts may be done in real time via security information and
event management (SIEM) or other systems, but note that no
SIEM or other device was mentioned. A dark web tracker was
made up for the question, and OSINT repositories wouldn’t
show real-time data like this.
■
159. B. Bluesnarfing involves accessing data from a Bluetooth device
when it is in range. Bluejacking involves sending unsolicited
messages to Bluetooth devices when they are in range. Evil twin
attacks use a rogue access point whose name is similar or
identical to that of a legitimate access point. A RAT is a remoteaccess
Trojan, and nothing in this scenario points to a RAT
being the cause of the stolen data.
■
160. B. The rules of engagement for a penetration test typically
include the type and scope of testing, client contact information
and requirements for when the team should be notified,
sensitive data handling requirements, and details of regular
status meetings and reports.
■
161. C. This command starts a reverse shell connecting to
example.com on port 8989 every hour. If you’re not familiar with
cron , you should take a moment to read the basics of cron

■
162. C. The penetration tester leveraged the principle of urgency
and also used some elements of authority by claiming to be a
senior member of the organization. They didn’t threaten or
intimidate the help desk staff member and did not make
something seem scarce, nor did they attempt to build trust with
the staff member.
■
163. A. Proprietary, or closed threat, intelligence is threat
intelligence that is not openly available. OSINT, or open source
threat intelligence, is freely available. ELINT is a military term
for electronic and signals intelligence. Corporate threat
intelligence was made up for this question.
■
164. B. CompTIA defines “maneuver” in the context of threat
hunting as how to think like a malicious user to help you identify
potential indicators of compromise in your environment.
Outside of the Security+ exam, this is not a commonly used term
in normal security practice, although it does make an
appearance in military usage. Since this term is not common
outside of the Security+ exam, make sure you understand the
CompTIA definition. Intelligence fusion adds multiple
intelligence sources together, threat feeds are used to provide
information about threats, and advisories and bulletins are often
combined with threat feeds to understand new attacks,
vulnerabilities, and other threat information.
■
165. B. Script kiddies are the least resourced of the common threat
actors listed above. In general, they flow from national state
actors as the most highly resourced, to organized crime, to
hacktivists, to inside actors, and then to script kiddies as the
least capable and least resourced actors. As with any scale like
this, there is room for some variability between specific actors,
but for the exam, you should track them in that order.
■
166. B. A SYN flood is a type of resource exhaustion attack and uses
up all available sessions on the system it is aimed at. Although a
SYN flood can be a DDoS, no mention was made of multiple
source machines for the attack. No application was mentioned,
and a SYN flood targets the TCP/IP stack on the system rather
than an application. No vulnerability was mentioned, and none
is required for a SYN flood, since it simply tries to overwhelm
the target’s ability to handle the opened connections.
Protections against SYN floods tend to focus on preventing
opened connections from causing resource exhaustion and
identifying and blocking abusive hosts.
■
167. A. Pretexting is a type of social engineering that involves using
a false motive and lying to obtain information. Here, the
penetration tester lied about their role and why they are calling
(impersonation), and then built some trust with the user before
asking for personal information. A watering hole attack
leverages a website that the targeted users all use and places
malware on it to achieve their purpose. Prepending is described
by CompTIA as “adding an expression or a phrase,” and
shoulder surfing involves looking over an individual’s shoulder
or otherwise observing them entering sensitive information like
passwords.
■
168. C. You may be familiar with the term war driving, but war
flying is increasingly common as drones have entered wide use.
Although penetration testers are somewhat unlikely to fly a
helicopter or airplane over a target site, inexpensive drones can
provide useful insight into both physical security and wireless
network coverage if equipped with the right hardware. Droning
and aerial snooping were made up for this question, and Air
Snarf is an old tool for capturing usernames and passwords on
vulnerable wireless networks.
■
169. C. Many organizations have legacy platforms in place that
cannot be patched or upgraded but that are still an important
part of their business. Security professionals are often asked to
suggest ways to secure the systems while leaving them
operational. Common options include moving the devices to an
isolated virtual LAN (VLAN), disconnecting the devices from the
network and ensuring they are not plugged back in, and using a
firewall or other security device to ensure that the legacy system
is protected from attacks and cannot browse the Internet or
perform other actions that could result in compromise.
■
170. B. According to the national council of ISACs, information
sharing and analysis centers, “Information Sharing and Analysis
Centers (ISACs) help critical infrastructure owners and
operators protect their facilities, personnel and customers from
cyber and physical security threats and other hazards. ISACs
collect, analyze and disseminate actionable threat information to
their members and provide members with tools to mitigate risks
and enhance resiliency.” IRTs are incident response teams,
Feedburner is Google’s RSS feed management tool, and vertical
threat feeds is not an industry term.
■
171. B. TCP port 23 is typically associated with Telnet, an
unencrypted remote shell protocol. Since Telnet sends its
authentication and other traffic in the clear (clear/plain text), it
should not be used, and Lucca should identify this as a
configuration issue involving an insecure protocol.
■
172. B. Privilege escalation attacks focus on gaining additional
privileges. In this case, Cameron used physical access to the
system to modify it, allowing him to then conduct a privilege
escalation attack as an unprivileged user. A Trojan would have
required a file to act like it was desirable, a denial-of-service
attack would have prevented access to a system or service, and
swapfiles (or pagefiles) are drive space used to contain the
contents of memory when memory runs low. Swapfiles may
contain sensitive data, but the term swapfile attack is not
commonly used.
■
173. C. Common attributes of threat actors that you should be able
to describe and explain for the Security+ exam include whether
they are internal or external threats, their level of sophistication
or capability, their resources or funding, and their intent or
motivation. The number of years of experience is difficult to
determine for many threat actors and is not a direct way to
gauge their capabilities, and is therefore not a common attribute
that is used to assess them.
■
174. B. Although engaging domain experts is often encouraged,
requiring third-party review of proprietary algorithms is not.
Many machine learning algorithms are sensitive since they are
part of an organization’s competitive advantage. Ensuring that
data is secure and of sufficient quality, ensuring a secure
development environment, and requiring change control are all
common artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)
security practices.
■
175. A. White teams act as judges and provide oversight of
cybersecurity exercises and competitions. Options B and C may
remind you of white- and gray-box tests, but they’re only there
to confuse you. Cybersecurity teams are usually referred to with
colors like red, blue, and purple as the most common colors, as
well as the white teams that the Security+ exam outline
mentions. Defenders in an exercise are part of the blue team.
■
176. C. Bug bounties are increasingly common and can be quite
lucrative. Bug bounty websites match vulnerability researchers
with organizations that are willing to pay for information about
issues with their software or services. Ransoms are sometimes
demanded by attackers, but this is not a ransom since it was
voluntarily paid as part of a reward system. A zero-day
disclosure happens when a vulnerability is disclosed and the
organization has not been previously informed and allowed to
fix the issue. Finally, you might feel like $10,000 is a payday, but
the term is not used as a technical term and doesn’t appear on
the exam.
■
177. A. Linux privileges can be set numerically, and 777 sets user,
group, and world to all have read, write, and execute access to
the entire /etc directory. Setting permissions like this is a
common workaround when permissions aren’t working but can
expose data or make binaries executable by users who should
not have access to them. When you set permissions for a system,
remember to set them according to the rule of least privilege:
only the permissions that are required for the role or task should
be configured.
■
178. B. Footprinting is the process of gathering information about a
computer system or network, and it can involve both active and
passive techniques. Mapping, fingerprinting, and aggregation
are not the correct or common terms for this practice.
■
179. C. When dial-up modems were in heavy use, hackers would
conduct war dialing exercises to call many phone numbers to
find modems that would answer. When wireless networks
became the norm, the same type of language was used, leading
to terms like war walking, war driving, and even war flying. The
rest of the options were made up, but you should remember that
the Security+ exam expects you to know about war driving and
war flying.
■
180. B. Lighting and utility systems, as well as SCADA, PLCs, CNC,
scientific equipment and similar devices are types of operational
technology. Since this is a distributed attack that results in a
denial of service, it is a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attack. OT systems are often isolated or otherwise protected
from remote network connections to prevent this type of attack
since many OT devices do not have strong security controls or
frequent updates. A SCADA overflow is not a term used in the
industry, but network and application DDoS attacks do appear
on the Security+ exam outline, and you will need to be able to
differentiate them from this type of OT DDoS.
■
181. C. A false negative occurs with a vulnerability scanning system
when a scan is run and an issue that exists is not identified. This
can be because of a configuration option, a firewall, or other
security setting or because the vulnerability scanner is otherwise
unable to detect the issue. A missing vulnerability update might
be a concern if the problem did not specifically state that the
definitions are fully up-to-date. Unless the vulnerability is so
new that there is no definition, a missing update shouldn’t be
the issue. Silent patching refers to a patching technique that
does not show messages to users that a patch is occurring. A
false positive would have caused a vulnerability to show that was
not actually there. This sometimes happens when a patch or fix
is installed but the application does not change in a way that
shows the change.
■
182. A. Refactoring a program by automated means can include
adding additional text, comments, or nonfunctional operations
to make the program have a different signature without
changings its operations. This is typically not a manual
operation due to the fact that antimalware tools can quickly find
new versions. Instead, refactoring is done via a polymorphic or
code mutation technique that changes the malware every time it
is installed to help avoid signature-based systems.
■
183. B. Hybrid warfare is a relatively new term that describes the
multipronged attacks conducted as part of a military or national
strategy of political warfare that uses traditional, asymmetric,
and cyberwarfare techniques along with influence methods to
achieve goals.
■
184. C. This is an example of a hoax. Hoaxes are fake security
threats and can consume both time and resources to combat.
User awareness and good habits for validating potential hoaxes
are both useful ways to prevent them from consuming more
time and energy than they should. A phishing attempt would
target credentials or other information, no identity information
is mentioned for identity fraud here, and an invoice scam
involves a fake or modified invoice.
■
185. B. This is an attempt to get the server to send a request to itself
as part of an API call, and it is an example of server-side request
forgery. A cross-site scripting attack would use the victim’s
browser rather than a server-side request, as would a CSRF
attack.
■
186. B. Threat hunting can involve a variety of activities such as
intelligence fusion, combining multiple data sources and threat
feeds, and reviewing advisories and bulletins to remain aware of
the threat environment for your organization or industry.
■
187. C. Passwords in memory are often stored in plain text for use.
This means that attackers can recover them if they can access
the memory where the password is stored, even if the storage is
ephemeral.
■
188. D. The AIS service uses STIX and TAXII. STIX and TAXII are
open standards that the Department of Homeland Security
started the development of and uses for this type of effort. You
can read more about AIS here: www.us-cert.gov/ais.
■
189. C. The reconnaissance phase of a penetration test involves
gathering information about the target, including domain
information, system information, and details about employees
like phone numbers, names, and email addresses.
■
190. A. Angela has impersonated an actual employee of the delivery
service to gain access to the company. Company uniforms are a
very useful element for in-person social engineering. Whaling is
a type of phishing attack aimed at leaders in an organization. A
watering hole attack deploys malware or other attack tools at a
site or sites that a target group frequently uses. Prepending is
vaguely defined by the Security+ exam but can mean a number
of things. When you see prepending on the exam, it should
normally mean “adding something to the front of text.”
■
191. D. Acquisition via the gray market can lead to lack of vendor
support, lack of warranty coverage, and the inability to validate
where the devices came from. Nick should express concerns
about the supply chain, and if his devices need to be from a
trusted source or supplier with real support he may need to
change his organization’s acquisition practices.
■
192. B. XML injection is often done by modifying HTTP queries sent
to an XML-based web service. Reviewing web server logs to see
what was sent and analyzing them for potential attacks will help
Christina see if unexpected user input is visible in the logs.
Syslog, authentication logs, and event logs are unlikely to
contain information about web applications that would show
evidence of an XML injection–based attack.
Use the following scenario for questions 193–195.
Frank is the primary IT staff member for a small company and
has migrated his company’s infrastructure from an on-site
datacenter to a cloud-based infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
provider. Recently he has been receiving reports that his website
is slow to respond and that it is inaccessible at times. Frank
believes that attackers may be conducting a denial-of-service
attack against his organization.
■
193. C. Frank’s best option is to review the anti-denial-of-service
and other security tools that his cloud hosting provider provides,
and to make appropriate use of them. The major infrastructure
as a service (IaaS) providers have a variety of security tools that
can help both detect and prevent DoS attacks from taking down
sites that are hosted in their infrastructure. Calling the cloud
service provider’s ISP will not work because the ISP works with
the cloud provider, not with Frank! It is possible the cloud
service provider might be able to assist Frank, but they are most
likely to instruct him to use the existing tools that they already
provide.
■
194. C. Since Frank is using the cloud service provider’s web
services, he will need to review the logs that they capture. If he
has not configured them, he will need to do so, and he will then
need a service or capability to analyze them for the types of
traffic he is concerned about. Syslog and Apache logs are both
found on a traditional web host, and they would be appropriate
if Frank was running his own web servers in the infrastructure
as a service (IaaS) environment.
■
195. B. The most useful data is likely to come from an IPS, or
intrusion prevention system. He will be able to determine if the
attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, and the IPS may be
able to help him determine the source of the denial-of-service
attack. A firewall might provide some useful information but
would only show whether or not traffic was allowed and would
not analyze the traffic for attack information. A vulnerability
scanner would indicate if there was an issue with his application
or the server, but it would not identify this type of attack.
Antimalware software can help find malware on the system but
isn’t effective against a DoS attack.
■
196. D. Contractual terms, auditing, and security reviews are all
common means of reducing third-party risks when working with
a vendor that is performing systems integration work. An SOC
(service organization controls) report would typically be
requested if you were going to use a third-party vendor’s
datacenter or hosted services.
■
197. B. Training an artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning
(ML) system with tainted data is a significant concern. Elias
needs to ensure that the traffic on his network is typical and
nonmalicious to ensure that the AI does not presume that
malicious traffic is normal for his network.
■
198. C. The most common motivation for hacktivists is to make a
political statement. Reputational gains are often associated with
script kiddies, whereas financial gain is most commonly a goal of
organized crime or insider threats. Gathering high-value data is
typical of both nation-state actors and organized crime.
■
199. D. Predictive analysis tools use large volumes of data, including
information about security trends and threats, large security
datasets from various security tools and other sources, and
behavior patterns, to predict and identify malicious and
suspicious behavior.
■
200. C. Identity fraud and identity theft commonly use Social
Security numbers as part of the theft of identity. Tailgating
involves following a person through a security door or gate so
that you do not have to present credentials or a code, whereas
impersonation is a social engineering technique where you claim
to be someone else. Blackmail is a potential answer, but the
most common usage is for identity fraud.
■
201. A. SOAR tools, like security information and event
management (SIEM) tools, are highly focused on security
operations. They include threat and vulnerability management,
security incident response, and security operations and
automation tools, but they do not provide source code analysis
and testing tools.
■
202. B. The Security+ exam outline specifically lists these items as
threat vectors. Although there are many others, you should be
familiar with direct access, wireless, email, supply chain, social
media, removable media, and cloud as vectors for the exam.
■
203. C. Although it may seem strange at first, both SourceForge and
GitHub are used to house sample exploit code as well as other
information that threat intelligence analysts may find useful.
They are not part of the dark web, nor are they an automated
indicator sharing (AIS) source or a public information sharing
center.
■
204. B. Trusting rather than validating user input is the root cause
of improper input handling. All input should be considered
potentially malicious and thus treated as untrusted. Appropriate
filtering, validation, and testing should be performed to ensure
that only valid data input is accepted and processed.
■
205. C. The code is an example of a PowerShell script that
downloads a file into memory. You can rule out the upload
options by reading the script since it mentions a download in the
script example. Since we see a string being downloaded, rather
than a file and location, you may be able to guess that this is a
fileless malware example.
■
206. C. Session IDs should be unique for distinct users and systems.
A very basic type of session replay attack involves providing a
victim with a session ID and then using that session ID once
they have used the link and authenticated themselves.
Protections such as session timeouts and encrypting session
data, as well as encoding the source IP, hostname, or other
identifying information in the session key, can all help prevent
session replay attacks.
■
207. B. The Security+ exam outline lists seven major impact
categories, including data loss, data breaches, and data
exfiltration. Data modification is not listed, but it is a concern as
part of the integrity leg of the CIA triad.
■
208. C. Academic journals are the slowest of the items listed because
of the review processes involved with most reputable journals.
Although academic journals can be useful resources, they are
typically not up-to-the-minute sources. Other resources you
should be aware of are vendor websites, conferences, social
media, and RFCs (requests for comments).
■
209. C. Vulnerability scans and port scans can often be detected in
logs by looking for a series of ports being connected to. In this
case, the log was created by scanning a system with an OpenVAS
scanner. There is no indication of a successful login or other
hacking attempt, and a service startup would show in the
messages log, not the auth log. A reboot would also show in the
messages log rather than the auth log.
■
210. C. Although it may be tempting to immediately upgrade,
reading and understanding the CVEs for a vulnerability is a good
best practice. Once Charles understands the issue, he can then
remediate it based on the recommendations for that specific
problem. Disabling PHP or the web server would break the
service, and in this case, only newer versions of PHP than 5.4
have the patch Charles needs.
■
211. D. Although 80 and 443 are the most common HTTP ports, it
is common practice to run additional web servers on port 8080
when a nonstandard port is needed. SSH would be expected to
be on port 22, RDP on 3389, and MySQL on 3306.
■
212. B. Once this issue is remediated, Rick should investigate why
the system was running a plug-in from 2007. In many cases,
when you discover a vulnerable component like this it indicates
a deeper issue that exists in the organization or processes for
system and application maintenance. Installing a web
application firewall (WAF) or reviewing intrusion prevention
system (IPS) logs may be useful if Rick thinks there are ongoing
attacks or that successful attacks have occurred, but the problem
does not state anything about that. There is no indication of
compromise, merely a completely outdated plug-in version in
the problem. If you want a sample system with vulnerable plugins
like this to test, you can download the 2015 release of the
Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) broken web
applications virtual machine. It has a wide range of completely
out-of-date applications and services to practice against.
■
213. C. A network device running SSH and a web server on TCP port
443 is a very typical discovery when running a vulnerability
scan. Without any demonstrated issues, Carolyn should simply
note that she saw those services. Telnet runs on port 21, an
unencrypted web server will run on TCP 80 in most cases, and
Windows fileshares use a variety of ports including TCP ports
135–139 and 445.
■
214. B. Configuration reviews, either using automated tool or
manual validation, can be a useful proactive way to ensure that
unnecessary ports and services are not accessible. Configuration
management tools can also help ensure that expected
configurations are in place. Neither passive nor active network
packet capture will show services that are not accessed, meaning
that open ports could be missed, and log review won’t show all
open ports either.
■
215. C. Errors are considered a vulnerability because they often
provide additional details about the system or its configuration.
They typically cannot be used to directly exploit or crash the
system.
■
216. D. This appears to be a situation where your network’s DNS
server is compromised and sending people to a fake site. A
Trojan horse is malware tied to a legitimate program. IP
spoofing would be using a fake IP address, but that is not
described in this scenario. In fact, the users are not even typing
in IP addresses—they are typing in URLs. Clickjacking involves
tricking users into clicking something other than what they
intended.
■
217. C. This is a classic example of typo squatting. The website is off
by only one or two letters; the attacker hopes that users of the
real website mistype the URL and are taken to their fake
website. Session hijacking is taking over an authenticated
session. Cross-site request forgery sends fake requests to a
website that purport to be from a trusted, authenticated user.
Clickjacking attempts to trick users into clicking on something
other than what they intended.
