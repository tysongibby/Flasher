1. C. The diagram shows services and ports, but it does not list the
protocol. Ben should ask if these are TCP- or UDP-based
services, since an incorrect guess would result in a
nonfunctional service, and opening up unnecessary protocols
may inadvertently create exposures or risks. The subnet mask is
shown where multiple systems in a network on the client side
require it, the service name isn’t necessary for a firewall rule,
and API keys should not be stored in documents like this.
■
2. A. The correct answer is the Open Web Application Security
Project (OWASP). It is the de facto standard for web application
security.
The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is
concerned with electrical power plant security, Trusted Foundry
is a term used to describe a secure supply chain for computer
ICs, and ISA/IEC standards are for securing industrial
automation and control systems (IACSs).
■
3. B. Vendor diversity gives two security benefits. The first is that
there is no single point of failure should one vendor cease
operations. The second benefit is that each vendor has a specific
methodology and algorithms used for detecting malware. If you
use the same vendor at all points where you need malware
detection, any flaw or weakness in that vendor’s methodology
will persist across the network. Using a single vendor means that
any weakness in that vendor’s methodology or technology could
impact the entire system or network. Vendor forking is not a
term in the industry, and this is not a neutral act; vendor
diversity improves security.
■
4. B. In this scenario, the best fit to Scott’s needs is a second
network attached storage (NAS) device with a full copy of the
primary NAS. In a failure scenario, the secondary NAS can
simply take the place of the primary NAS while individual disks
or even the whole NAS is replaced. Tape-based backups take
longer to restore, regardless of whether they are full or
incremental backups, although incremental backups can take
more time in some cases since swapping tapes in order can add
time to the restoration process. Finally, a cloud-based backup
system would be useful if Scott was worried about a local
disaster but would be slower than a local identical NAS, thus not
meeting Scott’s primary requirement.
■
5. C. Restoration order can be very important in a complex
environment due to system dependencies. Restoration order can
also ensure that the proper security controls are in place before
systems are online. A datacenter should be able to handle
systems coming online without failing if its power systems are
properly designed. A second outage due to failed systems would
mean that Yasmine has not determined why the outage has
occurred, making restoration potentially dangerous or
problematic. Finally, fire suppression systems should only
activate for an actual fire or when fire precursors like smoke are
detected, not for increased heat load.
■
6. B. Air gapping refers to the server not being on a network. This
means literally that there is “air” between the server and the
network. This prevents malware from infecting the backup
server. A separate VLAN or physical network segment can
enhance security but is not as effective as air gapping. A
honeynet is used to detect attacks against a network, but it
doesn’t provide effective defense against malware in this
scenario.
■
7. C. Windows picture passwords require you to click on specific
locations on a picture. This is an example of a something-youcan-
do factor. Geolocation or a network location are examples of
somewhere you are, whereas something you exhibit is often a
personality trait, and someone you know is exactly what it
sounds like: someone who can identify you as an individual.
■
8. C. Hash functions convert variable-length inputs into fixedlength
outputs while minimizing the changes of multiple inputs,
resulting in the same output (collisions). They also need to be
fast to compute. Hashes should not be reversible; they are a oneway
function!
■
9. B. The most common way to ensure that third-party secure
destruction companies perform their tasks properly is to sign a
contract with appropriate language and make sure that they
certify the destruction of the materials they are asked to destroy.
Manual on-site inspection by third parties is sometimes done as
part of certification, but federal certification is not a common
process. Requiring pictures of every destroyed document would
create a new copy, thus making it a flawed process.
■
10. A. Using both server-side execution and validation requires
more resources but prevents client-side tampering with the
application and data. For Olivia’s described needs, server-side
execution and validation is the best option.
■
11. D. An Arduino is a microcontroller well suited for custom
development of embedded systems. They are small, inexpensive,
and commonly available. Unlike a Raspberry Pi, they are not a
small computer, reducing their overall risk of compromise. A
custom field-programmable gate array (FPGA) will typically be
more complex and expensive than an Arduino, whereas a
repurposed desktop PC introduces all the potential issues that a
PC can include such as a vulnerable operating system or
software.
■
12. D. Digital signatures are created using the signer’s private key,
allowing it to be validated using their public key.
■
13. C. Adding one bit to a key doubles the work required. The
original effort would have 2128 potential solutions, whereas the
increased key length would require 2129. In real life, key lengths
aren’t increased by 1; instead, they are typically increased by
factors of 2, such as 128 to 265, or 1024 to 2048.
■
14. C. Key stretching is used to improve weak keys. One way of
implementing it is by repeatedly using a hash function or a block
cipher, increasing the effort that an attacker would need to exert
to attack the resulting hashed or encrypted data. The rest of the
options were made up.
■
15. A. A salt is a value added to a string before it is hashed. The salt
is stored so that it can be added to passwords when they are
used in the future to compare to the hash. Since each salt is
unique, this means that an attacker would need to generate a
unique rainbow table for every salt to be able to attack the stored
hashes effectively. For high-value passwords, this may be
worthwhile, but for bulk lists of passwords, it is not a reasonable
attack method.
■
16. C. Ian will use Michelle’s public key to encrypt the message so
that only she can read it using her private key. If he wanted to
sign the message, he could use his private key, and Michelle
could use his public key to validate his signature. Neither Ian
nor Michelle should ever reveal their private keys.
■
17. A. Elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) is faster because it can
use a smaller key length to achieve levels of security similar to a
longer RSA key (a 228-bit elliptical curve key is roughly
equivalent to a 2,380-bit RSA key). Using the same key to
encrypt and decrypt would be true for a symmetric encryption
cryptosystem; however, neither of these are symmetric. Either
algorithm can run on older processors given the right
cryptographic libraries or programming, although both will be
slower. Both can be used for digital signatures.
■
18. A. Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is used to change keys used to
encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring that even if a compromise
occurs, only a very small amount of data will be exposed.
Symmetric encryption uses a single key. Quantum key rotation
and Diffie-Hellman key modulation are both terms made up for
this question.
■
19. A. Checking a visitor’s ID against their log book entry can
ensure that the information they have recorded is correct and
that the person’s ID matches who they claim to be. Biometric
scans only work on enrolled individuals, meaning that many
guests may not have biometric data enrolled. Two-person
integrity control would only be useful if there was a concern that
a guard was allowing unauthorized individuals into the facility.
A security robot typically cannot validate a visitor’s identity from
an ID and log entry. This may change as they become more
advanced!
■
20. D. Honeypots are designed to attract a hacker by appearing to
be security holes that are ripe and ready for exploitation. A
honeynet is a network honeypot. This security technique is used
to observe hackers in action while not exposing vital network
resources. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to detect
activity that could indicate an intrusion or attack. Neither active
detection nor false subnet is a common industry term.
■
21. C. SCADA, or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
systems, are commonly used to manage facilities like power
plants. The rest of the options were made up.
■
22. D. Prime factorization algorithms and elliptic curve
cryptography are believed to be vulnerable to future quantum
computing–driven attacks against cryptographic systems.
Although this is largely theoretical at the moment, quantum
encryption may be the only reasonable response to quantum
attacks against current cryptographic algorithms and systems.
■
23. C. Geoff is looking for a warm site, which has some or all of the
infrastructure and systems he needs but does not have data. If a
disaster occurs, Geoff can bring any equipment that he needs or
wants to the site along with his organization’s data to resume
operations. A hot site is a fully functional environment with all
the hardware, software, and data needed to operate an
organization. They are expensive to maintain and run but are
used by organizations that cannot take the risk of downtime. A
cold site is a location that can be brought online but does not
have systems; cold sites typically have access to power and
bandwidth but need to be fully equipped to operate after a
disaster since they are just rented space. An RTO is a recovery
time objective, and it measures how long it should take to
resume operations; it is not a type of disaster recovery site.
■
24. B. If Olivia wants to ensure that third parties will be unable to
modify the operating system for Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, requiring signed and encrypted firmware for operating
system updates is an effective means of stopping all but the most
advanced threats. Setting a default password means that a
common password will be known. Checking the MD5sum for
new firmware versions will help administrators validate that the
firmware is legitimate, but signed and encrypted firmware is a
much stronger control. Finally, regular patching may help
secure the devices but won’t prevent OS modifications.
■
25. B. After quantum encryption and decryption technologies
become mainstream, it is generally believed that nonquantum
cryptosystems will be defeated with relative ease, meaning that
quantum cryptography will be required to be secure. Qubits are
quantum bits, not a measure of speed; quantum encryption will
be the relevant solution in a post-quantum encryption world;
and even very long RSA keys are expected to be vulnerable.
■
26. B. Counter mode (CTR) makes a block cipher into a stream
cipher by generating a keystream block using a nonrepeating
sequence to fill in the blocks. This allows data to be streamed
instead of waiting for blocks to be ready to send. It does not
perform the reverse, turning a stream cipher into a block cipher,
nor does it reverse the encryption process (decryption). Public
keys cannot unlock private keys; they are both part of an
asymmetric encryption process.
■
27. D. Blockchain public ledgers contain an identity for
participants (although the identity may be semi-anonymous),
the transaction record, and the balance or other data that the
blockchain is used to store. Since there is no central authority,
there is no token to identify authorities.
■
28. C. A test server should be identical to the production server.
This can be used for functional testing as well as security testing,
before deploying the application. The production server is the
live server. A development server would be one the
programmers use during development of a web application, and
predeployment server is not a term typically used in the
industry.
■
29. C. Staging environments, sometimes called preproduction
environments, are typically used for final quality assurance (QA)
and validation before code enters the production environment
as part of a deployment pipeline. Staging environments closely
mirror production, allowing realistic testing and validation to be
done. Development and test environments are used to create the
code and for testing while it is being developed.
■
30. C. Application programming interface (API) keys are frequently
used to meet this need. An API key can be issued to an
individual or organization, and then use of the API can be
tracked to each API key. If the API key is compromised or
abused, it can be revoked and a new API key can be issued.
Firewall rules written to use public IP addresses can be fragile,
since IP addresses may change or organizations may have a
broad range of addresses that may be in use, making it hard to
validate which systems or users are using the API. Credentials,
including passwords, are not as frequently used as API keys.
■
31. D. Embedded systems like smart meters typically do not
include a SQL server to attack, making SQL injection an unlikely
issue. Derek should focus on securing the traffic from his meter,
ensuring that denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are difficult to
accomplish and that remotely disconnecting the meter using
exposed administrative interfaces or other methods is
prevented.
■
32. A. Honeypots are systems configured to appear to be
vulnerable. Once an attacker accesses them, they capture data
and tools while causing the attacker to think that they are
successfully gaining control of the system. This allows defenders
like Selah to study and analyze their techniques and tools
without endangering their production systems. An intrusion
detection system (IDS) or intrusion protection system (IPS) can
detect and stop attacks, and may even capture some tools, but
they are not designed to capture local commands and
downloaded tools. A WAF is a web application firewall and is
intended to stop attacks on web applications.
■
33. D. Honeynets are intentionally vulnerable networks set up to
allow for capture and analysis of attacker techniques and tools.
A black hole is a term commonly used for a system or network
device where traffic is discarded, and black hole routing involves
sending traffic to a null route that goes nowhere.
■
34. B. Maria should implement ongoing auditing of the account
usage on the SCADA system. This will provide a warning that
someone’s account is being used when they are not actually
using it. Host-based antivirus is almost never a bad idea, but this
scenario did not indicate that the compromise was due to
malware, so antimalware may not address the threat. Since the
engineer has access to the SCADA system, a network intrusion
prevention system (NIPS) is unlikely to block them from
accessing the system, and full-disk encryption (FDE) will not
mitigate this threat because the system is live and running,
meaning that the disk will be decrypted in use.
■
35. B. Both Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data
Encryption Standard (DES) are block ciphers. That means that
they encrypt groups (blocks) of plain-text symbols together as a
single block. If you know that either AES or DES is a block
cipher, you can eliminate half of the options here. If you know
that a block cipher works on groups of symbols or blocks of text,
you can also eliminate half the options as incorrect.
■
36. A. A hardware security module (HSM) is the most secure way
to store private keys for the e-commerce server. An HSM is a
physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys. Fulldisk
encryption (FDE) will protect the data on the e-commerce
server, but it won’t help store the key. It is also difficult to fully
encrypt the e-commerce server drive, since the drive will need to
be in use for the e-commerce to function. A self-encrypting drive
(SED) is merely automatic full-disk encryption. Softwaredefined
networking (SDN) won’t address the issues in this
scenario, since it configures networks via software and does not
provide secure key storage.
■
37. B. Transit gateways are a transit hub used to connect VPCs
(virtual private clouds) to on-premises networks. You can read
more about transit gateways at
docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transitgateway.
html. IBM uses the same term, but for a very specific
internal cloud connection.
■
38. C. You should implement a staging server so that code can be
deployed to an intermediate staging environment. This will
allow testing of security features, as well as checking to see that
the code integrates with the entire system. Using third-party
libraries and software development kits (SDKs) can help reduce
errors and vulnerabilities in the code. Sandboxing is used to
isolate a particular environment, and virtualization will not
mitigate this risk. Even if the production server is virtualized,
the risks are the same. Finally, deployment policies are a good
idea, but they are not the most effective way to mitigate this
particular risk.
■
39. C. Ian should be concerned that attackers might be able to
redirect short message service (SMS) messages sent to VoIP
phones. This potential issue is one reason that some multifactor
deployments do not allow SMS messages to be sent to VoIP
phones in the environment, and some organizations do not
allow SMS as an option, instead requiring hardware tokens or
application-based multifactor authentication. Vishing is a type
of phishing done via voice, voicemail hijacking would redirect
voicemail to another mailbox by forwarding calls, and weak
multifactor code injection was made up for this question.
■
40. A. Baseline configurations, per NIST 800-53: “Baseline
configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or
changes to information systems. Baseline configurations include
information about information system components (e.g.,
standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook
computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices;
current version numbers and patch information on operating
systems and applications; and configuration
settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical
placement of those components within the system architecture.
Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new
baselines as organizational information systems change over
time. Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the
current enterprise architecture.”
■
41. B. HVAC systems are an important part of the availability for
systems and infrastructure. They are also a target for attackers
who target Internet of Things (IoT) or network-connected
devices. They are not frequent targets for use in social
engineering efforts, although they could be used that way. They
are not a primary line of defense for organizations.
■
42. B. Symmetric encryption is typically faster than asymmetric
encryption. This is why many protocols use asymmetric
encryption to exchange a symmetric key, and then use that key
for the rest of their transaction. It is not more secure, key length
is not a meaningful difference between symmetric and
asymmetric encryption, and key distribution for symmetric
encryption is more challenging for larger populations using
symmetric encryption if confidentiality needs to be maintained
because every potential pair of communicators would need a
different symmetric key.
■
43. C. Entropy is a measure of uncertainty. Having sources of
entropy (or randomness) is a key element in a PRNG. Some
pseudo-random number generators rely on input from
keyboards, mice, or other human-generated inputs to have a
source of entropy data.
■
44. A. With the software as a service (SaaS) model, the consumer
has the ability to use applications provided by the cloud provider
over the Internet. SaaS is a subscription service where software
is licensed on a subscription basis. Platform as a service (PaaS)
provides the framework and underlying tools to build
applications and services. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
provides the components of an entire network and systems
infrastructure. Hybrid models use both cloud and locally hosted
systems.
■
45. C. Resource policies are associated with a resource and allow
you to determine which principals have access to that resource
as well as what actions they can take on it. Resource policies are
not used to set consumption limits.
■
46. D. Storage area network (SAN) replication copies the contents
of one repository to another repository, such as an
organization’s central SAN environment to a remote SAN at the
hardware or block level.
■
47. C. A snapshot is an image of the virtual machine (VM) at some
point in time. It is standard practice to periodically take a
snapshot of a virtual system so that you can return that system
to a last known good state. Sandboxing is the process of isolating
a system or software. The hypervisor is the mechanism through
which the virtual environment interacts with the hardware, and
elasticity is the ability for the system to scale.
■
48. D. RAID level 5 is disk striping with distributed parity. It can
withstand the loss of any single disk. RAID 0 is disk striping; it
does not provide any fault tolerance. RAID 1 is mirroring. It
does protect against the loss of a single disk but not with
distributed parity. RAID 3 is disk striping with dedicated parity.
This means a dedicated drive containing all the parity bits.
■
49. D. A Faraday cage, named after physicist Michael Faraday,
involves placing wire mesh around an area or device to block
electromagnetic signals. A VLAN can segment a network but
won’t block electromagnetic interference (EMI). Softwaredefined
networking (SDN) virtualizes a network but does not
protect against EMI. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is used
for cryptographic applications.
■
50. B. The correct answer is bollards. These are large objects, often
made of concrete or similar material, designed specifically to
prevent a vehicle getting past them. Most gates can be breached
with a vehicle. A security guard is a good idea, but they would
not be able to stop a vehicle from ramming the building.
Security cameras will provide evidence of a crime that was
committed but won’t prevent the crime.
■
51. A. Attaching cable locks to the computers and locking them to
the table will make it more difficult for someone to steal a
computer. Full-disk encryption (FDE) won’t stop someone from
stealing the computer, nor will strong passwords. A sign-in sheet
is a good idea and may deter some thefts, but it is not the best
approach to stopping theft offered in this scenario.
■
52. B. The correct answer is to incorporate two-factor
authentication with a mantrap. By having a smartcard at one
door (type II authentication) and a PIN number (type I
authentication) at the other door, Joanne will combine strong
two-factor authentication with physical security. Smartcards by
themselves, or paired with a fence, are still single-factor
authentication. Video surveillance, though often a good idea,
won’t help with two-factor authentication.
■
53. A. Baselining is the process of establishing a standard for
security. A change from the original baseline configuration is
referred to as baseline deviation. Security evaluations or audits
check security but don’t establish security standards. Hardening
is the process of securing a given system, but it does not
establish security standards. Normalization is the process of
removing redundant entries from a database.
■
54. A. Fake telemetry is telemetry created to make an attacker
believe that a honeypot system is a legitimate system. Building a
believable honeypot requires making the system as realistic as
possible. Deepfakes are artificial intelligence (AI)-created videos
that make it appear that individuals are saying or doing actions
they never actually performed. The rest of the options were
made up for this question.
■
55. A. RAID 1+0, or RAID 10, is a mirrored data set (RAID 1),
which is then striped (RAID 0): a “stripe of mirrors.” RAID 6 is
disk striping with dual parity (distributed), RAID 0 is just
striping, and RAID 1 is just mirroring.
■
56. D. Normalization is the process of removing duplication or
redundant data from a database. There are typically four levels
of normalization ranging from 1N at the lowest (i.e., the most
duplication) to 4N at the highest (i.e., the least duplication).
Although database integrity is important, that is not what is
described in the question. Furthermore, integrity checking
usually refers to checking the integrity of files. Deprovisioning is
a virtualization term for removing a virtual system (server,
workstation, etc.) and reclaiming those resources, and in the
context of identity management means removing an account or
permissions. Baselining involves setting security standards.
■
57. C. Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)
provides authentication, authorization, and accounting, which
make up the three critical elements in AAA systems. OpenID is a
protocol for authentication but does not provide authorization
by itself. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a
directory service, and Security Assertion Markup Language
(SAML) is a markup language for making security assertions.
■
58. D. TLS inspection (often called SSL inspection because the
term SSL remains widely, if incorrectly, in use) involves
intercepting encrypted traffic between the client and server. TLS
interception devices act as an on-path attack and decrypt traffic
to scan and analyze it, often for malware or other signs of
attacks, and then encrypt it to send it on to its destination. As
you might expect, TLS inspection has both legitimate and
malicious uses.
■
59. D. In most cases none of these options are practical.
Destruction of drones is an illegal destruction of private
property. Jamming the open frequencies used for drones is not
permissible and may result in action by the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), and contacting the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to request that the airspace above a
company be declared a no-fly zone is not something the FAA
supports in most cases. This means that Diana is likely to have
to deal with the potential for drone-based threats in other ways.
■
60. B. Isaac has built and configured a system where
nonpersistence of systems can create forensic challenges. His
organization needs to consider how they can make copies of
compromised or problematic ephemeral systems and store them
in a safe location for forensic analysis. This is not a forensicresistant
system—if he had a copy, he would have been able to
analyze it. Live-boot media is not mentioned or used in this
example, and terminate and stay resident (TSR) is a type of
program run in the DOS operating system that returned control
to the operating system but remained in memory so that it could
be easily run again as needed.
■
61. D. Stored procedures are the best way to have standardized
SQL. Rather than programmers writing their own SQL
commands, they simply call the stored procedures that the
database administrator creates. Formal code inspection might
detect a lack of security practices and defenses but won’t stop
SQL-based attacks. Policies requiring stored procedures might
help but are a less direct path to the solution. Finally, agile
programming is a method for developing applications rapidly
and won’t determine how SQL commands are created.
■
62. C. Services integration in cloud and virtualization
environments can be very complex and can involve data, APIs,
and other types of application integration. Integration platforms
allow organizations to use a standardized tool rather than
building and maintaining their own. This allows them to focus
on the actual integrations rather than the underlying system,
saving time and effort. Since integration platforms also often
have preexisting tools for common services and APIs, they can
save significant amounts of time for organizations that adopt
them. Of course, this also introduces another platform to assess
and secure.
■
63. B. When virtualization reaches the point that IT can no longer
effectively manage it, the condition is known as VM sprawl. VM
overload and VM spread are made up for this question, and a
VM zombie is a term for a virtual machine that is running and
consuming resources but no longer has a purpose.
■
64. A. VM escape is a situation wherein an attacker is able to go
through the VM to interact directly with the hypervisor and
potentially the host operating system. The best way to prevent
this is to limit the ability of the host and the VM to share
resources. If possible, they should not share any resources.
Patching might mitigate the situation, but it is not the most
effective solution. Using firewalls and antimalware tools is a
good security practice but would have minimal effect on
mitigating VM escape.
■
65. A. Irene is looking for a software-as-a-service (SaaS) tool that
allows her to perform the specific function that her organization
needs to accomplish. An SaaS service does not require system
administration or programming and typically requires minimal
configuration to perform its normal functionality. Platform-asa-
service (PaaS) typically requires some configuration or
programming, and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) will require
systems administration, programming, or configuration—or all
three! Identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) is a specific type of solution
that was not described as part of Irene’s needs.
■
66. D. Serverless architectures do not require a system
administrator because the provider manages the underlying
function-as-a-service (FaaS) capability. It can also scale up or
scale down as needed, allowing it to be very flexible. Serverless
architectures are typically not ideal for complex applications and
instead tend to work better for microservices.
■
67. A. The correct answer is to have a motion-activated camera
that records everyone who enters the server room. Motion
recognition is an important feature in this type of scenario,
where cameras operate in a space where there is little physical
traffic and storage would be wasted by recording empty, unused
spaces. Smartcards, deadbolts, and logging won’t detect theft.
■
68. C. A Domain Name System (DNS) sinkhole is a DNS server
used to spoof DNS servers that would normally resolve an
unwanted to malicious hostname. Traffic can be sent to a
legitimate system, causing warnings to appear on the user’s
screen, or simply sent to a null route or nonexistent system. An
intrusion detection system (IDS) cannot stop traffic, roundrobin
DNS is a way to spread DNS traffic, and a WAF is a web
application firewall, and nothing in this question indicates that
there is a web-specific issue.
■
69. C. Hot aisle/cold aisle is a layout design for server racks and
other computing equipment in a datacenter. The goal of a hot
aisle/cold aisle configuration is to conserve energy and lower
cooling costs by managing airflow. An infrared camera will
detect heat levels on the aisles. Although the rest of the options
are potential issues for a datacenter, an infrared camera won’t
help with them.
■
70. D. A security guard is the most effective way to prevent
unauthorized access to a building. Options A, B, and C are all
incorrect. These are all good physical security measures, but
they are not the most effective ways to prevent entry into a
building.
■
71. B. Software-defined networking (SDN) makes the network very
scalable. It is relatively easy to add on new resources or remove
unneeded resources, and it helps with high availability efforts.
SDN does not stop malware, detect intrusions, or prevent
session hijacking.
■
72. A. The correct answer is to use an application container to
isolate that application from the host operating system.
Application containers provide a virtualized environment in
which to run an application. Moving to software-defined
networking (SDN) is a very involved process and does not
provide an efficient solution. Running the application in a
separate VLAN will not separate the application from the host
operating system; it might not solve the problem. Since this is a
legacy application, insisting on an updated version of the
application isn’t feasible.
■
73. D. Each of the options above is a potential risk when using
third-party libraries or SDKs. Organizations need to understand
and assess the risks of third-party code, but it is a common
practice to use third-party libraries. Identifying trustworthy and
reliable sources and managing the versions and updates are
critical to using third-party components safely.
■
74. B. A cloud access security broker (CASB) is used to monitor
cloud activity and usage and to enforce security policies on users
of cloud services.
■
75. A. Microservice architectures build applications as a set of
loosely coupled services that provide specific functions using
lightweight protocols. It doesn’t specifically define the size of the
systems, but it is not a tightly coupled environment. Protocol
choice is often open standards-based, but the emphasis is on
lightweight protocols. There is not a requirement that services
be in-house or third party exclusively.
■
76. C. The correct answer is to implement IaC. Infrastructure as
code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning
computer datacenters through machine-readable definition files,
rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive
configuration tools. Whether the datacenter(s) use physical
machines or virtual machines, this is an effective way to manage
the datacenters. Although datacenter managers may be needed,
that won’t necessarily provide consistent management across
the enterprise. Software-defined networking (SDN) will not fix
this problem, but it would help if she needed to configure and
manage her network based on usage and performance. Finally,
this issue is not just about provisioning; it is about management.
■
77. D. OAuth is a common authorization service used for cloud
services. It allows users to decide which websites or applications
to entrust their information to without requiring them to give
them the user’s password. OpenID is frequently paired with
OAuth as the authentication layer. Kerberos is more frequently
used for on-site authentication, and SAML is Security Assertion
Markup Language.
■
78. C. In this scenario Greg should identify the use of the printers
for further attacks against the organization as the most critical
risk. Use as part of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack
does not directly impact the organization in most cases,
exhausting supplies would be an annoyance, and the risk of
scanning documents from a remote location requires sensitive
documents to be left in the MFPs. Greg should note that all of
these issues could be problems and move the MFPs to a
protected network so that third parties can’t access them.
■
79. D. The systems that Keith has deployed are thin clients,
computers that do not run their applications and storage from
their local drives and instead rely on a remote server. Cloud and
virtualization implementations of this providing virtual desktops
are called VDI, or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, but do not
necessarily require a thin client, since they can work on a fully
capable computer (or thick client). Client-as-a-server is a madeup
term.
■
80. B. This real-world example was found in 2020 when malicious
PowerShell code was discovered that triple-encoded malicious
tools. The initial package was downloaded as an image from
imgur.com or similar sites and was concealed using
steganographic techniques. The code was also encrypted using
RSA and encoded in Base64 both prior to encryption and again
after encryption. Although steganography is not incredibly
common, Henry should suspect that a downloaded image may
be more than it appears.
■
81. A. Storing data in plain text will not help prevent data exposure
and, in fact, is more likely to result in data exposure. Instead,
Molly should encourage her developers to store and transmit
sensitive data in an encrypted form. They should also leverage
HTTPS for all authenticated pages, and potentially all pages.
Hashing passwords using salts is important for password
security, and ensuring that tokens are not exposed via sites like
GitHub or other public code repositories is important for
application and data security.
■
82. C. Using secure firmware, as well as using an RTOS with time
and space partitioning, are both common methods to help
ensure RTOS security. Unlike traditional operating systems,
real-time operating systems are used in applications where they
need to deal with inputs immediately. That means that adding
additional load like firewalls and antimalware is not a typical
component in RTOS applications. For similar reasons, you’re
unlikely to find a web browser on most devices running an
RTOS.
■
83. B. In a code reuse attack, the attacker executes code that is
meant for some other purposes. In many cases this can be old
code that is no longer even used (dead code), even if that code is
in a third-party library. A buffer overflow occurs when too much
data is sent to a buffer. For example, say a buffer is designed to
hold 10 bytes, and it is sent 100 bytes, causing the additional
data to be put into unexpected memory locations. A denial-ofservice
(DoS) attack is meant to make a service or system
unavailable to legitimate users. Session hijacking involves taking
over an existing authenticated session.
■
84. C. Zigbee is specifically designed for this type of usage.
Narrowband radios are not typically in use for this type of
purpose, and baseband radio requires very large antennas to use
the low-frequency spectrum. Cellular options require a carrier
and are not well suited to direct peer-to-peer configurations.
■
85. B. Homomorphic encryption can perform computations on the
ciphertext without access to the private key that the ciphertext
was encrypted with. When the computations are completed, the
results are the same as if those computations had been
performed against the original plain text. Identity-preserving
and replicable encryption were made up for this question.
■
86. A. Fingerprint reader systems are the most widely accepted
biometric systems in common use for entry access and other
purposes today. Facial recognition systems are increasingly in
use and are also likely to be more accepted by user populations
based on their broad deployment in phones, but they are not
listed as an option. Both retina and iris scans are less likely to be
accepted, whereas voice systems are both relatively uncommon
and more disruptive for frequent usage.
■
87. C. Tape backups are the most common solution for cold
backups off-site. Cloud backups to a cold repository are
increasingly popular options and may be faster for some
retrieval scenarios, but they are not listed as options. Storage
area network (SAN) and network-attached storage (NAS)
devices are not commonly used for cold backup and are instead
used for online or nearline options. Disk backup could be used
but remains less common than tape for a true cold backup
scenario.
■
88. B. Off-site storage has to balance availability and the ability to
be used in the event that a disaster or other event occurs. In this
case, Allan should look at a facility far enough away that a single
disaster cannot take both sites offline.
■
89. D. Embedded systems can bring a broad range of security
implications, many of which are driven by the limited
capabilities of the processors and hardware they are frequently
built with. Low-power consumption designs may lack
computational power and thus have challenges implementing
strong cryptography, network connectivity, and other similar
problems. Patching embedded systems can be challenging both
because of where they are deployed and because of a lack of
connectivity for them—in fact, in many environments, you may
not want the devices to be connected to your network. Since
many don’t have a screen, keyboard, or a network connection,
authentication is also a problem. Few embedded devices,
however, need bulk storage, making the lack of bulk storage a
problem that typically isn’t a major concern.
■
90. B. System on a chip (SoC) devices are complete self-contained
systems on a single chip. Therefore, having their own unique
cryptographic keys is the best way to implement authentication
and security. Option A is incorrect. A system on a chip is selfcontained,
so a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) would not be an
appropriate solution. Option C is incorrect. A self-encrypting
drive (SED) is not relevant to system on a chip, since that system
does not have a “drive.” Option D is incorrect. Many SoC
technologies don’t use a BIOS.
■
91. A. Such systems need to have all communications encrypted.
As of the current date, breaches of portable network devices
have all involved unencrypted communications. Option B is
incorrect. Full-disk encryption (FDE) may or may not even be
appropriate for such devices. Many don’t have a disk to encrypt.
Option C is incorrect. It may not be possible to install
antimalware on many such devices. Option D is incorrect. Fuzz
testing is used for applications.
■
92. D. The more vehicles utilize computers and have network
communication capabilities, the more they will be vulnerable to
cyberattacks. Options A, B, and C are all incorrect, as all of these
are concerns rather than just one.
■
93. A. An advantage of compiling software is that you can perform
static code analysis. That means Amanda can review the source
code for flaws and could even remediate flaws if they were
found. Both binaries and compiled code can be tested in a live
environment (dynamic analysis), and checksums for both can be
validated.
■
94. A. RFCs, or requests for comment, are how Internet protocols
are defined and documented. Wikipedia is not the definitive
resource, and the Internet Archive actively archives the Internet
but does not define protocols.
■
95. C. Standard naming conventions typically do not help to
conceal systems from attackers. Attackers can still scan for
systems and may even be able to use the naming convention to
identify the purpose of a system if the naming convention
includes a purpose or technology in the name. Naming
conventions do make standardization easier and can help
administrators quickly identify what a machine does, while
making it simpler to include systems in scripts. A machine that
doesn’t match is likely to be a rogue or misconfigured.
■
96. B. This is an example of a continuous integration/continuous
delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. There is no mention of monitoring
systems, and although code analysis is happening here in
testing, it is dynamic testing, not source code analysis. There is
no mention of malware in the pipeline.
■
97. D. Although gait analysis is not commonly used for
identification and authorization purposes, it is used in situations
where crowd footage is available to identify individuals. Vein,
voiceprint, and fingerprint analysis are not useful in most
scenarios involving heavily used and crowded spaces.
■
98. C. A community cloud presents a compromise solution.
Community clouds are semi-private. They are not accessible to
the general public but only to a small community of specific
entities. There are risks with public clouds, as there are with any
environment. Private clouds can be quite expensive to build out,
particularly for smaller organizations that cannot afford staffing
or hardware. Finally, recommending against a cloud solution
does not match the company’s stated goal.
■
99. D. Using infrastructure as a service (IaaS) makes the most
sense here; it meets the cloud requirement described and would
allow additional systems to be quickly created or removed as
needed. Platform as a service (PaaS) does not provide direct
access to Linux systems to build out applications and related
configuration. Setting up dual boot and building machines are
not cloud solutions as described. When you answer questions
like this, make sure you read and meet all the requirements in
the question.
■
100. A. One of the dangers of automation and scripting is that the
scripts will do exactly what they are written to do. That means
that a script like those that Corrine has been asked to write that
doesn’t have rules that prevent it from blocking critical systems
could block those systems. There is no indication in the question
of any issues with private IP addresses, and filtering them would
require more work. Attackers could potentially use the scripts if
they discovered them, but if they’re able to access security
scripts there is likely a deeper problem. Finally, auditors
typically do not review scripts and instead ask about the
existence of controls.
■
101. D. Differential backups back up all of the changes since the last
full backup. An incremental backup backs up all changes since
the last incremental backup. A snapshot captures machine state
and the full drive at a bitwise level, and full backups are a
complete copy of a system but typically do not include the
memory state.
■
102. C. The correct answer is a public cloud. Public clouds are
usually less expensive. The cloud provider has a number of
customers and costs are dispersed. Even individuals can afford
to use cloud storage with services like iCloud and Amazon
Cloud. A community cloud is usually private for a small group of
partners. Each of the partners must share a greater part of the
expense than they would with a public cloud, but they retain
more control over the cloud than they would with a public cloud.
Private clouds are often the most expensive for smaller
organizations. The company must completely develop and
maintain the cloud resources and cannot leverage shared
resources. A hybrid deployment model is a good compromise for
many situations, but it will typically be more expensive than a
public cloud for a small organization.
■
103. C. The crossover error rate (CER) is the point where the FAR
(false acceptance rate) and the FRR (false rejection rate) cross
over. CER provides a means of comparing biometric systems
based on their efficiency, with a lower CER being more
desirable.
■
104. B. Elasticity is a cloud computing concept that matches
resources to demand to ensure that an infrastructure closely
matches the needs of the environment. Scalability is the ability
to grow or shrink as needed but does not directly include the
concept of matching to workload. Normalization is a code
development concept used to ensure that data is in a consistent
form.
■
105. A. An uninterruptable power supply (UPS) should be
Nathaniel’s first priority. Ensuring that power is not disrupted
during an outage and can be maintained for a short period until
alternate power like a generator can come online is critical, and
a UPS can provide that capability. A generator alone will take
longer to come online, resulting in an outage. Dual power
supplies can help to build resilience by allowing multiple power
sources and avoiding issues if a power supply does fail, but that
is not the focus of the question. A managed power distribution
unit (PDU) provides remote management and power monitoring
but will not prevent power loss in an outage.
■
106. B. Virtual machine (VM) sprawl refers to a situation in which
the network has more virtual machines than the IT staff can
effectively manage. The remaining options do not match the
term VM sprawl.
■
107. C. Stored procedures are commonly used in many database
management systems to contain SQL statements. The database
administrator (DBA), or someone designated by the DBA,
creates the various SQL statements that are needed in that
business, and then programmers can simply call the stored
procedures. Stored procedures are not related to dynamic linked
libraries (DLLs). Stored procedures can be called by other stored
procedures that are also on the server. Finally, stored
procedures are not related to middleware.
■
108. D. Bollards are large barriers that are often made of strong
substances like concrete. They are effective in preventing a
vehicle from being driven into a building. None of the other
answers match the purpose of a bollard.
■
109. D. Selah should be concerned about cloning the badges because
magnetic stripe badges are relatively simple to clone in most
cases. Tailgating is common, particularly if there are large
numbers of employees, since employees are unlikely to allow
doors to close and then reopen them for every person who enters
during shift changes. Since magnetic stripe readers do not
require any additional information, use by unauthorized
individuals is easy if a badge is lost or stolen.
■
110. A. Virtual machine (VM) escape attacks rely on a flaw in the
hypervisor that could allow an attacker to attack the hypervisor
itself. Typical system administration best practices can help,
including regular patching of the hypervisor, but in the event of
a successful escape attack, limiting damage by keeping VMs of
the same sensitivity level isolated to the same host can prevent
broader impact. Antivirus is always a good idea and may even
stop some malware-based VM escape attacks, but isolating the
VM is more effective. Full-disk encryption (FDE) will have no
effect since the disk must be unencrypted during operation. A
Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is used for storing
cryptographic keys.
■
111. C. Managed security service providers (MSSPs) are an outside
company that handles security tasks. Some or even all security
tasks can be outsourced, including intrusion detection and
prevention (IDS/IPS) management, security information and
event management (SIEM) integration, and other security
controls. Software-defined networking (SDN) would make
managing security somewhat easier but would itself be difficult
to implement. Automating as much security activity as is
practical would help alleviate the problem but would not be as
effective as security as a service. Finally, only implementing a
few security controls would likely leave control gaps.
■
112. B. Cryptographic hashes are used for integrity checking of files,
network packets, and a variety of other applications. Storing a
cryptographic hash of the application and comparing the
application on the network to that hash will confirm (or refute)
whether the application has been altered in any way. Network
intrusion detection or network intrusion prevention systems
(NIPSs/NIDSs) are useful, but they won’t prevent an application
from being altered. Sandboxing is used to isolate an application,
but it won’t detect whether it has been tampered with.
■
113. C. Separating the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition) system from the main network makes it less likely
that the SCADA system can be affected from the main network.
This includes malware as well as human action. Softwaredefined
networking (SDN) would make isolating the SCADA
system easier but would not actually isolate it. Patch
management is always important, but in this case, it would not
have prevented the issue. Encrypted data transmissions, such as
TLS, would have no effect on this situation.
■
114. B. Gordon should implement a version numbering scheme and
ensure that the proper current version of software components
is included in new releases and deployments. Developers could
still manually reintroduce old code, but version numbering
helps to ensure that you have a current version in use. Neither
continuous deployment nor continuous integration will prevent
old code from being inserted, and release management may rely
on version numbering but won’t prevent it by itself.
■
115. D. Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides a reliable method
of encrypting web traffic. It supports mutual authentication and
is considered secure. Although Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) can
encrypt web traffic, TLS was created in 1999 as its successor.
Although many network administrators still use the term SSL, in
most cases today what you are using is actually TLS, not the
outdated SSL. PPTP and IPSec are protocols for establishing a
VPN, not for encrypting web traffic.
■
116. A. Smartcards can support modern cryptographic algorithms,
meaning that weak security due to a smartcard’s limitations on
encryption is not a common issue. Smartcard readers and
maintenance do add additional expense, and user experiences
are limited by the need to have the card in hand and insert it or
present it to a reader either during authentication or for entire
sessions. Smartcards typically have a PIN or password, meaning
that they are used for multifactor, not single-factor,
authentication.
■
117. D. Setting off an alarm so that staff become used to it being a
false positive is a technique that penetration testers may use if
they can gain access to a facility. Once staff are used to alarms
going off and ignore it, the penetration testers can enter areas
that are alarmed without a response occurring. Setting off the
alarm as part of a test isn’t typical for penetration testers, and
disabling the alarm and waiting for the lack of an alarm to be
reported is also more likely to be part of an internal test, not a
penetration test. Asking staff members to open the door is not a
means of making alarms less effective, and staff members who
know the door is alarmed are unlikely to do so.
■
118. C. The term “XaaS” refers to anything as a service, a broad
reference to the huge number of options that exist for services
via third-party providers. The rest of the options for this
question were made up for the question.
■
119. D. Signage plays multiple roles in secure environments,
including discouraging unwanted or unauthorized access,
providing safety warnings, and helping with evacuation routes
and other navigation information as part of a physical safety
effort.
■
120. B. Nora has established a cold site. A cold site is a location that
can be brought online but does not have systems; cold sites
typically have access to power and bandwidth, but they need to
be fully equipped to operate after a disaster since they are just
rented space. Warm sites have some or all of the infrastructure
and systems Nora needs but does not have data. A hot site is a
fully functional environment with all of the hardware, software,
and data needed to operate an organization. They are expensive
to maintain and run but are used by organizations that cannot
take the risk of downtime. A MOU is a memorandum of
understanding and is not a type of disaster recovery site.
■
121. A. Windows calls the point that it saves to return to a known
good configuration a system restore point. Matt should set one
prior to installing new software or patching if he is worried
about what might occur. The rest of the options are not
Windows terms.
■
122. A. TOTP, or time-based one-time password, algorithms rely on
the time being accurate between both of the authentication
hosts. That means that if a system or device is not properly
synced to an authoritative and correct time server, or if its local
system time has drifted, the authentication may fail. Although
TOTP systems have some flexibility, a clock that is sufficiently
incorrect will cause an issue. HMAC-based one-time password
(HOTP) and short message service (SMS)-based multifactor
systems do not suffer from this issue, and MMAC was made up
for this question.
■
123. C. Object detection capabilities can detect specific types or
classes of objects and can be used to determine if the object is
moved. In this case, Nina could enable object detection to notify
her when packages are delivered, and she may be able to
specifically select an object to monitor for additional security.
Infrared capabilities are useful in low-light situations, motion
detection helps to preserve storage space by only recording
when motion occurs, and facial recognition could help identify
specific individuals but won’t help with packages.
■
124. C. Although user health data is a concern for the wearer of the
device, unless the device is required by the organization, the
user’s health data is typically not an organizational security
concern. GPS location data, data exposure from data that is
copied to or accessible from the device, and the potential for
devices to act as unsecured wireless gateways to the
organization’s network are all common security concerns for
wearables. Lack of patching, lack of device encryption, and the
inability to enforce compliance or security policies are also
common concerns for wearables.
■
125. D. A Faraday cage is a metal wire mesh designed to block
electromagnetic interference (EMI). None of the other answers
describe what a Faraday cage is used for or capable of.
■
126. B. Smartcards paired with electronic locks can be used to allow
entrance into a building. The smartcard system can also store
information about the user, and thus the system can log who
enters the building. A security guard with a sign-in sheet would
function, but there are many ways to subvert a sign-in sheet, and
a guard can be distracted or become inattentive. This makes
smartcard access a better solution. Guards are also more
expensive over time. A camera would record who enters but
would not control access. A nonemployee could enter the
building. An uncontrolled/supervised sign-in sheet would not be
secure.
■
127. D. Although electronic locks offer a number of advantages,
including the ability to provide different codes or access to
different users and the ability to deprovision access, they also
require power, whether in the form of a battery or constantly
provided power from a power source. That means that power
loss can cause issues, either due to the lock remaining locked or
defaulting to an open state.
■
128. A. Managing her organization’s IP address schema and usage
will allow Kara to identify unknown and potentially rogue
devices. IP addresses are not used to secure encryption keys, and
managing a schema will not help prevent denial-of-service
attacks. Keeping track of what IP addresses are in use can help
avoid IP address exhaustion, but this does not provide a direct
security advantage.
■
129. C. Of the locks listed here, deadbolts are the most secure. The
locking bolt goes into the door frame, making it more secure.
Whether a lock uses a key or combination does not change how
secure it is. Key-in-knob is a very common, and generally
provides less resistance to bypass than a deadbolt-based
solution. Finally, padlocks can be cut off with common bolt
cutters.
■
130. B. NIC teaming can provide greater throughput by sending
traffic through multiple network interface cards (NICs) while
also ensuring that loss of a card will not cause an outage, thus
providing fault tolerance.
■
131. A. False acceptance rate (FAR) is the rate at which the system
incorrectly allows in someone it should not. This is clearly a
significant concern. Any error is a concern, but the false
rejection rate is less troublesome than the false acceptance rate.
The cross-over error rate (CER) is when the FAR and the false
rejection rate (FRR) become equal. This indicates a consistent
operation of the biometric system. The equal error rate is
another name for cross-over error rate.
■
132. C. Data sovereignty refers to the concept that data that is
collected and stored in a country is subject to that country’s
laws. This can be a complex issue with multinational cloud
services and providers that may store data in multiple countries
as part of their normal architecture. It may also create
compliance and other challenges based on differences in
national laws regarding data, data privacy, and similar issues.
■
133. A. Low-power devices typically have limited processor speed,
memory, and storage, meaning that encryption can be a
challenge. Fortunately, solutions exist that implement lowpower
cryptographic processing capabilities, and continued
advances in processor design continue to make lower-power
processors faster and more efficient. Legal limitations do not
typically take into account whether a device is a low-power
device, and public key encryption can be implemented on a wide
range of CPUs and embedded systems, so factoring prime
numbers is unlikely to be an issue.
■
134. A. A secure cabinet or safe is tamper-proof and provides a good
place to store anything you are trying to physically protect.
Encrypting thumb drives would require you to store the key
used to encrypt the thumb drive, thus continuing the problem. It
is actually a good practice to store BitLocker keys on removable
media, provided that media is safeguarded. In most cases, desk
drawers are not secure and can easily be broken into, even if
they are locked.
■
135. D. RAID 6, disk striping with dual parity, uses a minimum of
four disks with distributed parity bits. RAID 6 can handle up to
two disks failing. RAID 3 is byte-level striping with dedicated
parity and cannot tolerate more than a single drive failing. RAID
0 is disk striping, which cannot handle disk failure, and RAID 5,
disk striping with distributed parity, can handle only one disk
failing.
■
136. C. The ability to record is not included in many traditional
closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring systems and is a key
element of investigations of theft and other issues. Motion
activation and facial recognition are typically associated with
computer-based camera systems but do not directly address the
concern Maria is working to handle. Infrared cameras would be
more useful in spaces where lights were not always in use, such
as outdoors or in facilities that are not occupied at night.
■
137. C. Static codes are typically recorded in a secure location, but if
they are not properly secured, or are otherwise exposed, they
can be stolen. Brute-force attempts should be detected and
prevented by back-off algorithms and other techniques that
prevent attacks against multifactor authentication systems.
Collisions exist with hashing algorithms, not with static
multifactor codes, and clock mismatch issues occur for timebased
one-time password (TOTP) codes.
■
138. B. A symmetric cryptosystem will typically perform faster and
with less processor overhead and thus lower latency than
asymmetric cryptosystems. Hashing is not encryption, and onetime
pads are not implemented in modern cryptosystems,
although they may have uses in future quantum cryptographic
solutions.
■
139. A. Industrial camouflage efforts minimize how noticeable a
facility is, helping it to remain unnoticed by casual observers.
Although industrial camouflage can be useful, it is rarely
effective against determined adversaries. A demilitarized zone
(DMZ) in information security terms is a network segment that
is intentionally exposed to the public with appropriate security
protecting, while stronger security is applied to nonpublic
resources. Disruptive coloration is a camouflage technique but
not one used in information security. Industrial obfuscation was
made up for this question.
■
140. A. Asymmetric cryptography has a relatively high
computational overhead, making symmetric key encryption
faster. That means that once you can exchange an ephemeral
symmetric key, or a series of keys, you can encrypt and send
data more quickly and efficiently using symmetric encryption.
There is no key length limitation, and reasonable lifespans are
met with either technology. Key reuse is not an issue with a
public key encryption scheme.
■
141. D. Failure to release memory you have allocated can lead to a
memory leak. Therefore, if you are using a programming
language like C++ that allows you to allocate memory, make
certain you deallocate that memory as soon as you are finished
using it. Allocating only the variable size needed and declaring
variables where needed are good programming practices.
However, failure to follow them just leads to wasteful use of
memory; it does not lead to a security problem like a memory
leak. Although this is a good idea to prevent buffer overflows, it
is not a memory management issue.
■
142. B. Using a longer key is the best way to make it less likely that
an encrypted file will be cracked. This does not prevent issues
with the algorithm itself, but if a vulnerability is not found in an
algorithm, adding key length will help ensure that even
significant increases in computational power will not result in
the encryption being cracked in a reasonable period of time.
Quantum computing has the potential to change this, but
practical quantum encryption cracking tools are not known to be
available yet. There is no such thing as an anti-quantum cipher,
and a rotating symmetric key might be used to ensure that a key
could not be cracked but does not provide longevity. Instead, it
is used to allow ephemeral communications to be less likely to
be cracked on an ongoing basis.
■
143. C. The best answer from this list is DLP, or data loss prevention
technology. DLP is designed to protect data from being exposed
or leaking from a network using a variety of techniques and
technology. Stateful firewalls are used to control which traffic is
sent to or from a system, but will not detect sensitive data. OEM
is an original equipment manufacturer, and security information
and event management (SIEM) can help track events and
incidents but will not directly protect data itself.
■
144. C. Encryption keys used for quantum key distribution are sent
in the form of qubits. The polarization state of the qubits reflects
the bit values of the key. Once sent, the receiver can validate the
state of some of those qubits to ensure both sender and receiver
have the same key. Bytes and bits are used in traditional data
exchanges, and nuquants were made up for this question.
■
145. B. Two-person control schemes require two individuals to be
involved to perform an action. This means that Alicia can
implement a two-person control scheme knowing that both
individuals would have to be involved to subvert the control
process. Biometrics will merely validate that a person is who
they say they are, robotic sentries do not add any particular
value to this scenario, and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) is used to
keep front-facing systems in a zone that can be controlled and
secured.
■
146. A. Social login is an example of a federated approach to using
identities. The combination of identity providers and service
providers, along with authorization management, is a key part of
federation. AAA is authentication, authorization, and accounting
and is typically associated with protocols like RADIUS. Privilege
creep occurs as staff members change jobs and their privileges
are not adjusted to only match their current role. IAM is a
broader set of identity and access management practices.
Although IAM may be involved in federated identity, this
question does not directly describe IAM.
■
147. A. USB data blockers are used to ensure that cables can only be
used for charging, and not for data transfer. None of the other
answers to this question are used for this purpose, and in fact all
were made up—USB is a serial bus, circuit breakers are used for
power, and HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP) is a type
of multifactor token algorithm.
■
148. B. In the platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model, the consumer has
access to the infrastructure to create applications and host them.
Software-as-a-service (SaaS) supplies a particular application;
infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) does not directly provide the
ability to create applications, although this distinction is quickly
blurring; and IDaaS is identity-as-a-service.
■
149. B. Avoiding reuse of the key components of an encryption
process means that even if a malicious actor managed to break
the encryption for a message or exchange, the next new
initialization vector (IV) and key would require an entirely new
brute-force attack. Using a new IV and key does not make bruteforce
attacks impossible, nor does it make brute force easier. A
single successful attack would expose a single message, or
however much data was encrypted using that IV and key.
■
150. C. The Linux kernel uses user-driven events like keystrokes,
mouse movement, and similar events to generate randomness
(entropy). The time of day is not random, user logins are
typically not frequent enough or random enough to be a useful
source of entropy, and network packet timing is not used for
this. If you encounter a question like this and don’t know where
to start, consider what you know about entropy—it is
randomness, so you would be looking for the input that would
have the most randomness to it. Thus, you could rule out the
time of day, and likely user logins. After that, you might consider
what could be controlled by an external party: network packets
being sent to the system, and rule that out as a potential attack
vector. That leaves keyboard input and mouse movement.
■
151. C. Elliptic curve encryption schemes allow the use of a shorter
key for the same strength that an RSA key would require,
reducing the computational overhead required to encrypt and
decrypt data. That doesn’t mean you should use a short key;
instead, you must select a key length that matches your
requirements for resistance to brute force and other attacks.
Hashing is nonreversible and is not a form of encryption.
■
152. C. Lighting serves a deterrent control, making potential
malicious actors feel like they may be observed without dark
areas or shadows to hide in. It does not detect actions, it does
not compensate for the lack of another control, and although
some lights may turn on for motion, the primary purpose is to
deter malicious or unwanted actions.
■
153. C. Edge computing places both data storage and computational
power closer to where it is needed to save on bandwidth and to
improve the response of associated applications and services.
Hybrid computing combines local and cloud computing. Local
cloud builds cloud infrastructure on local systems. Mist
computing was made up for this question but may sound similar
to fog computing, a term that has a similar meaning to edge
computing, which uses local computation and storage that is
then Internet connected.
■
154. D. Ben has deployed a tokenization scheme. Encryption would
require the data to be decrypted to be used, and this is not
mentioned. Hashing could be used to conceal values but does
not preserve the ability to work with the data. Masking modifies
content to conceal personally identifiable information or other
sensitive information.
■
155. D. Fencing is both a useful deterrent because it discourages
malicious actors from accessing the grounds that Dana wants to
protect. It is also an example of a physical control. A visitor log
is an administrative control and will not deter malicious actors.
Motion detectors and cameras are examples of detective
controls.
■
156. A. Adding a digital signature can ensure that both the message
has not been changed, and thus its integrity is intact, and that it
supports nonrepudiation by proving that the message is from
the sender who claims to have sent it.
■
157. B. Attestation processes request responsible managers or
others to validate that user entitlements or privileges are correct
and match those that the user should have. Attestation is not an
employment verification process, although managers may
discover that users who have left the organization still have
rights as part of an attestation process. It does not require proof
of identity or validation of security controls.
■
158. B. A generator is the most appropriate answer to a multihour
outage. Although a hot site would allow her organization to stay
online, the cost of a hot site is much higher than that of a
generator. A PDU, or power distribution unit, is used to manage
and distribute power, not to handle power outages. Finally, UPS
systems are not typically designed to handle long outages.
Instead, they condition power and ensure that systems remain
online long enough for a generator to take over providing power.
■
159. A. A MAC supports authentication and integrity and is used to
confirm that messages came from the sender who is claimed to
have sent it and also ensure that recipients can validate the
integrity of the message. It does not help with confidentiality.
■
160. C. Inert gas systems are used to reduce the oxygen in a room
without the hazard to staff that carbon dioxide systems use.
Both dry-pipe and pre-charge systems use water, which can
harm delicate electronics.
■
161. C. Proximity card readers usually work using RFID (radio
frequency ID) technology. This allows cards to be used in
proximity but without requiring a direct reader like a magnetic
stripe. Neither biometrics or infrared are used for proximity
card readers.
■
162. A. Digital signatures that use a sender’s private key provide
nonrepudiation by allowing a sender to prove that they sent a
message. Unless the sender’s private key has been compromised,
signing a message with their private key and allowing the
recipient to validate the signature using their public key ensures
that the sender sent the message in question. Longer keys don’t
prove who a sender is, hashes are not reversible, and the public
key in use is the sender’s, not the recipient’s.
■
163. B. Natural disasters, as well as man-made disasters, are
primary considerations for geographic security considerations.
Placing backup sites outside of the likely path or range of a
single disaster helps ensure continuity of operations for
organizations. MTR is the maximum time to restore, sprawl
avoidance is usually considered for virtual machines, and service
integration is a consideration for service architectures, not
geographical placement.
■
164. B. Although actual threats from drones and unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) are relatively rare for most organizations,
placing sensitive areas further inside a building will deter most
current generations of drones from entering or recording them.
Security doors and other common obstacles will prevent most
UAV or drone penetration that typical organizations will face.
Fences are easily bypassed by flying drones, biometric sensors
won’t stop a drone from hovering outside of a window, and
Faraday cages might stop a drone from receiving commands if
you could get the drone inside first!
■
165. D. The key trade-off when considering resource constraints for
encryption is that stronger encryption with longer keys requires
more computational time and resources. This means that it will
be slower and will consume more of the capacity of a system. A
balance between security and computational overhead needs to
be struck that matches the confidentiality needs of the data that
is being handled or sent. Stronger encryption is usually slower,
running out of entropy in the scenario described is not a typical
concern, and stronger encryption taking up significant amounts
of drive space is also not a real issue in this scenario.
■
166. C. Encrypting the message will ensure that it remains
confidential as long as only the recipient is able to decrypt it.
Hashing the message will result in the message not being
recoverable, whereas digitally signing it can provide
nonrepudiation. Finally, quantum encryption algorithms and
the systems required to use them are not available today,
meaning Amanda won’t be able to use them—yet!
■
167. C. In most cases, the major cloud service providers have more
security staff and a greater budget for security operations. This
means they can invest more in security controls, staffing,
monitoring, and other activities. Using a cloud service provider
can help improve the overall security posture of an organization
that might not have the ability to have full-time or dedicated
security staff or expertise. At the same time, local staff will
understand the business better and will usually have a faster
response time to critical business needs.
■
168. D. Network load balancers distribute traffic among systems,
allowing systems to be added or removed, and making patching
and upgrades easier by draining connections from systems and
removing them from the pool when work needs to be done on
them. They can also help monitor systems for performance,
report on issues, and ensure that loads match the capabilities of
the systems that they are in front of. Firewalls are used for
security, switches are a network device used to transfer traffic to
the correct system, and a horizontal scaler was made up for this
question.
■
169. D. Protected cable distribution uses such controls as electrical,
electromagnetic, and even acoustic or air pressure sensors to
ensure that cables and distribution infrastructure are not
accessed, allowing sensitive information to be transmitted in
unencrypted form. The U.S. government identifies three
options: hardened carrier, alarmed carrier, and continuously
viewed protected distribution systems. Shielded cables are used
to prevent EMI.
■
170. B. Maureen is using the concept of audio steganography by
hiding data inside an audio file in a way that conceals it from
detection. The other options are made up for this question.
■
171. B. Since Nicole is specifically worried about SMS pushes to cell
phones, the most likely attack model is SIM (subscriber identity
module) cloning, allowing attackers to obtain the authentication
codes sent to legitimate users. Attacks on a Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) system would typically help intercept SMS if it
was sent to VoIP phones, not cell phones (although forwarding
is possible, but not mentioned here). Brute-force attacks are
unlikely to succeed against SMS phone factors, and rainbow
tables are used to crack hashed passwords.
■
172. C. Encryption is often used to protect data at rest. When data
needs to be accessed, it can be decrypted. Hashing is not
reversible, meaning that it is not used for data storage when the
original form is needed for processing. Comparing hashed
passwords works because the password is presented again,
rather than the password needing to be retrieved from storage.
TLS is used to protect data in motion, and tokenization is a data
security technique that replaces sensitive data elements with
nonsensitive elements that can still be processed in useful ways.
■
173. B. Nathaniel has created an air gap, a physical separation that
will require manual transport of files, patches, and other data
between the two environments. This helps to ensure that
attackers cannot access critical systems and that insiders cannot
export data from the environment easily. A demilitarized zone
(DMZ) is a separate network segment or zone that is exposed to
the outside world or other lower trust area. A vault is a secured
space or room, but vaulting is not a term used on the Security+
exam, and a hot aisle is the aisle where servers exhaust warm
air.
■
174. A. Masking modifies content to conceal personally identifiable
information (PII) or other sensitive information. Tokenization
replaces sensitive information with a nonsensitive alternative
that allows the data to still be processed in useful ways.
Encryption would require the data to be decrypted to be used,
and this is not mentioned. Hashing could be used to conceal
values but does not preserve the ability to work with the data.
■
175. C. On-premises cloud computing is often called private cloud.
Not all private clouds have to be on-site, because private clouds
could be deployed to a remote location like a third-party hosting
facility. Infrastructure as a service and platform as a service
refer to third-party hosting services, and hybrid cloud combines
both on-premises and cloud computing models.
■
176. C. The most likely threat to physical tokens is theft or loss
resulting in access to the token. Cloning tokens might be
possible if the token’s seed were known, but they are designed to
prevent this from being reverse-engineered, meaning a
significant breach of the vendor or similar issue would be
required to cause an exposure. Brute force is not a realistic
threat against most token implementations, nor is algorithm
failure.
■
177. D. Control diversity means utilizing different controls to
mitigate the same threat. For malware, the use of technical
controls, such as antimalware, is critical. But it is also important
to have administrative controls, such as good policies, and to
ensure that employees are properly trained. Thus, for this
question a combination of policies, training, and tools is the best
answer.
■
178. A. Although it may seem like Charles has presented two factors,
in fact he has only presented two types of things he knows along
with his identity. To truly implement a multifactor environment,
he should use more than one of something you have, something
you know, and something you are.
■
179. C. Salt reuse is a critical mistake, because it would allow a
rainbow table to be generated using that salt. Although standard
rainbow tables would not work, a reused salt would only require
the creation of a single new rainbow table. Alphanumeric salts
are not a problem, long salts are not a problem, and this salt is a
reasonable length at 16 characters using hexadecimal.
■
180. B. Alaina’s need for a local, secure storage area is an ideal
situation for the use of a vault or safe where the keys can be
stored on a device like a thumb drive. Simply placing them on a
drive leaves them vulnerable to theft, and an air-gapped system
would also be potentially exposed to theft or local breaches.
■
181. B. It is critical to authenticate API users and then to authorize
them to take actions. If you authorized first and then
authenticated, users could take action before you knew who they
were! Encrypting throughout the use of the API keeps data and
queries secure, validating input and filtering out dangerous
strings is important to prevent injection and other attacks, and
auditing and logging allows you to troubleshoot and respond to
issues and attacks.
■
182. C. Frank has used a degausser to erase the data on the tapes.
Degaussing only works on magnetic media like tapes and will
not work on optical or flash media. Burning media or materials
is exactly what it sounds like—putting them into a fire!
Shredding and pulping are mechanical means of destruction.
■
183. A. 5G requires higher antenna density for full bandwidth
communication than previous technologies, meaning that
Angela’s organization will have to carefully consider antenna
placement, particularly inside buildings where structural
elements can create challenges with signal propagation. 5G is
usable indoors, is commercially available, and can coexist with
traditional Wi-Fi, so Angela should not include those in her list
of concerns.
■
184. A. Chris is concerned about privilege creep, the slow
accumulation of privileges over time as staff members change
roles and their privileges are not removed or updated. Privilege
management processes would help to prevent this, thus keeping
data more secure. Of the other options, only privilege escalation
is a common term, and it means gaining additional privileges,
typically as part of an attack from an account with fewer
privileges to a more privileged account like an administrator or
root account.
■
185. C. Honeyfiles are files that are intended to help detect
attackers. They are placed in a location where accessing them
can be detected but are not set up to allow users to access them.
That means that attackers who access the seemingly desirable
file can be easily detected and appropriate alerts can be sent.
■
186. C. Although there is no specific recommended distance,
recommendations typically range from 60 to 120 miles away to
ensure that a single disaster is unlikely to disable both locations.
■
187. B. Fog computing is a term coined by Cisco to describe cloud
computing at the edge of an enterprise network. The more
common term for this is edge computing, but you may
encounter both terms. Fog implementations handle significant
amounts of computation, communication, and storage activities
locally, while also connecting to cloud services to perform some
of the work.
■
188. A. Bcrypt, scrypt, and PBKDF2 are all examples of key
stretching algorithms. MD5 and SHA1 are both hashing
algorithms, and ncrypt was made up for this question.
■
189. C. The only directory service listed is Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP). SAML is Security Assertion Markup
Language, OAuth is an authorization delegation protocol, and
802.1x is a network authentication protocol.
