1. C. The correct answer is spear phishing. Spear phishing is
targeted to a specific group, in this case insurance professionals.
Although this is a form of phishing, the more specific answer is
the one you will need to choose on questions like this. Phishing
uses social engineering techniques to succeed but is once again a
broader answer than spear phishing and thus is not the correct
choice. Finally, a Trojan horse pretends to be a legitimate or
desirable program or file, which this scenario doesn’t describe.

2. B. A logic bomb is malware that performs its malicious activity
when some condition is met. A worm is malware that selfpropagates.
A Trojan horse is malware attached to a legitimate
program, and a rootkit is malware that gets root or
administrative privileges.
■
3. C. This is a very basic form of SQL injection. Cross-site
scripting would have JavaScript in the text field and would be
designed to impact other sites from a user’s session. Cross-site
request forgery would not involve any text being entered in the
web page, and ARP poisoning is altering the ARP table in a
switch; it is not related to website hacking.
■
4. B. This describes a jamming attack, where legitimate traffic is
interfered with by another signal. Jamming can be intentional or
unintentional and may be intermittent. IV attacks are obscure
cryptographic attacks on stream ciphers. Wi-Fi protected setup
(WPS) uses a PIN to connect to the wireless access point (WAP).
The WPS attack attempts to intercept that PIN in transmission,
connect to the WAP, and then steal the WPA2 password. A
botnet is a group of machines that are being used, without their
consent, as part of an attack.
■
5. B. The best option listed to defend against the attacks
mentioned is input validation. Encrypting the web traffic will
not have any effect on these two attacks. A web application
firewall (WAF) might mitigate these attacks, but it would be
secondary to input validation, and an intrusion detection system
(IDS) will simply detect the attack—it won’t stop it.
■
6. C. If users have been connecting but the AP does not show
them connecting, then they have been connecting to a rogue
access point. This could be the cause of an architecture and
design weakness such as a network without segmentation and
control of devices connecting to the network. Session hijacking
involves taking over an already authenticated session. Most
session hijacking attacks involve impersonation. The attacker
attempts to gain access to another user’s session by posing as
that user. Clickjacking involves causing visitors to a website to
click on the wrong item. Finally, bluejacking is a Bluetooth
attack.
■
7. C. Cross-site scripting involves entering a script into text areas
that other users will view. SQL injection is not about entering
scripts, but rather SQL commands. Clickjacking is about tricking
users into clicking on the wrong thing. Bluejacking is a
Bluetooth attack.
■
8. D. Retaining the actual password is not a best practice, and
thus encrypting password plain text is not a common technique
to make passwords harder to crack. Since the application would
need the cryptographic key to read the passwords, anybody who
had access to that key could decrypt the passwords. Using a salt,
a pepper, and a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed for
passwords are all common best practices to prevent offline
brute-force attacks.
■
9. A. Although this is one of the more dated items on the
Security+ exam outline, you need to know that the term for
Internet messaging spam messages is SPIM. The rest of the
answers were made up, and though this shows up in the exam
outline, the rest of the world has moved on from using this term.
■
10. B. A segmentation fault will typically stop the program from
running. This type of issue is why a NULL pointer or other
pointer de-referencing error is considered a potential security
issue, as a denial-of-service condition impacts the availability of
the service. This type of error is unlikely to cause a data breach
or allow privilege escalation, and permissions creep occurs as
individuals accrue more permissions over time in a single
organization as their permissions are not cleaned up when they
switch positions or roles.
