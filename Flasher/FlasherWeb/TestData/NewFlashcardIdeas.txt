RAID 5 is disk striping with distributed parity. It can withstand the loss of any single disk. 
RAID 0 is disk striping; it does not provide any fault tolerance. 
RAID 1 is mirroring. It does protect against the loss of a single disk but not with distributed parity. 
RAID 3 is disk striping with dedicated parity. This means a dedicated drive containing all the parity bits.
RAID 1+0, or RAID 10, is a mirrored data set (RAID 1), which is then striped (RAID 0): a “stripe of mirrors.” 
RAID 6 is disk striping with dual parity (distributed), 
RAID 0 is just striping
RAID 1 is just mirroring

Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is used to change keys used to encrypt and decrypt data, ensuring that even if a compromise occurs, only a very small amount of data will be exposed.

watering hole attack places malware or malicious code on a site or sites that are frequently visited by a targeted group.

Asymmetric warfare is warfare between groups with significantly different power or capabilities.

A zero-day attack takes place when hackers exploit the flaw before developers have a chance to address it.

Card cloning often occurs after a skimming attack is used to capture card data, whether from credit cards or entry access cards. 

What is a time check/time of use flaw? When a multithreaded application does not properly handle various threads accessing a common value, and one thread can change the data while another thread is relying on it.

What is a pharming attack? attempts to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate site to another malicious site. Attackers most often do this by changing the local hosts file or by exploiting a trusted DNS server.

What is STIX? Structured Threat Information eXpression is a standardized XML programming language for conveying data about cybersecurity threats in a common language that can be easily understood by humans and security technologies.

What is TAXII? Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information, defines how cyber threat information can be shared via services and message exchanges. It is designed specifically to support STIX information, which it does by defining an API that aligns with common sharing models.

What is SCADA? Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition is a control system architecture comprising computers, networked data communications and graphical user interfaces for high-level supervision of machines and processes. It also covers sensors and other devices, such as programmable logic controllers, which interface with process plant or machinery.

7 Types of Cyber Security Threats (correct answer for sec+ exam?)
https://onlinedegrees.und.edu/blog/types-of-cyber-security-threats/
Cyber security professionals should have an in-depth understanding of the following types of cyber security threats.

1. Malware
Malware is malicious software such as spyware, ransomware, viruses and worms. Malware is activated when a user clicks on a malicious link or attachment, which leads to installing dangerous software. Cisco reports that malware, once activated, can:

Block access to key network components (ransomware)
Install additional harmful software
Covertly obtain information by transmitting data from the hard drive (spyware)
Disrupt individual parts, making the system inoperable
2. Emotet
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) describes Emotet as “an advanced, modular banking Trojan that primarily functions as a downloader or dropper of other banking Trojans. Emotet continues to be among the most costly and destructive malware.”

3. Denial of Service
A denial of service (DoS) is a type of cyber attack that floods a computer or network so it can’t respond to requests. A distributed DoS (DDoS) does the same thing, but the attack originates from a computer network. Cyber attackers often use a flood attack to disrupt the “handshake” process and carry out a DoS. Several other techniques may be used, and some cyber attackers use the time that a network is disabled to launch other attacks. A botnet is a type of DDoS in which millions of systems can be infected with malware and controlled by a hacker, according to Jeff Melnick of Netwrix, an information technology security software company. Botnets, sometimes called zombie systems, target and overwhelm a target’s processing capabilities. Botnets are in different geographic locations and hard to trace.

4. Man in the Middle
A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when hackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. After interrupting the traffic, they can filter and steal data, according to Cisco. MITM attacks often occur when a visitor uses an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. Attackers insert themselves between the visitor and the network, and then use malware to install software and use data maliciously.

5. Phishing
Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the receiver into opening it and carrying out the instructions inside, such as providing a credit card number. “The goal is to steal sensitive data like credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim’s machine,” Cisco reports.

6. SQL Injection
A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection is a type of cyber attack that results from inserting malicious code into a server that uses SQL. When infected, the server releases information. Submitting the malicious code can be as simple as entering it into a vulnerable website search box.

7. Password Attacks
With the right password, a cyber attacker has access to a wealth of information. Social engineering is a type of password attack that Data Insider defines as “a strategy cyber attackers use that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves tricking people into breaking standard security practices.” Other types of password attacks include accessing a password database or outright guessing.
