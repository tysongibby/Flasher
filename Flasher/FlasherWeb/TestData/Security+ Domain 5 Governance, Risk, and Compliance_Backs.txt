1. A. Caroline should select ISO 27002. ISO 27002 is an
international standard for implementing and maintaining
information security systems. ISO 27017 is an international
standard for cloud security; NIST 800-12 is a general security
standard and it is a U.S. standard, not an international one; and
NIST 800-14 is a standard for policy development, and it is also
a U.S. standard, not an international one.
■
2. B. If a system is infected with malware, the malware will
operate with the privileges of the current user. If you use
nonadministrative accounts, with least privileges, then the
malware won’t be able to access administrative functionality
without a privilege escalation capability.
■
3. D. Least privilege is the most fundamental concept in
establishing accounts. Each user should have just enough
privileges to do their job. This concept also applies to service
accounts. Although each of the other options is something you
would consider, they are not as critical as the principle of least
privilege.
■
4. C. Change management is the process of documenting all
changes made to a company’s network and computers. Avoiding
making changes at the same time makes tracking any problems
that can occur much simpler. Due diligence is the process of
investigation and verification of the accuracy of a particular act.
Acceptable use policies state what actions and practices are
allowed in an organization while using technology. Due care is
the effort made by a reasonable party to avoid harm to another.
It is the level of judgment, care, determination, and activity a
person would reasonably expect to do under certain conditions.
■
5. A. An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a document stating what a
user may or may not have access to on a company’s network or
the Internet. A clean desk policy ensures that all
sensitive/confidential documents are removed from an end-user
workstation and locked up when the documents are not in use.
Mandatory vacation policy is used by companies to detect fraud
by having a second person, familiar with the duties, help
discover any illicit activities. Job rotation is a policy that
describes the practice of moving employees between different
tasks. Job rotation can help detect fraud because employees
cannot perform the same actions for long periods of time.
■
6. C. The PCI-DSS, or Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard, is a security standard that is mandated by credit card
vendors. The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council
is responsible for updates and changes to the standard. GDPR,
or the General Data Protection Regulation, is a standard for data
privacy and security in the European Union (EU). COPPA is the
Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, a U.S. federal law. CIS
is the Center for Internet Security and is not a law or a
regulation.
■
7. A. Companies will use mandatory vacation policies to detect
fraud by having a second person, familiar with the duties, help
discover any illicit activities. Clean desk policy ensures that all
sensitive/confidential documents are removed from an end-user
workstation and locked up when the documents are not in use. A
nondisclosure agreement (NDA) protects sensitive and
intellectual data from getting into the wrong hands. Continuing
education is the process of training adult learners in a broad list
of postsecondary learning activities and programs. Companies
will use continuing education in training their employees on the
new threats and also reiterating current policies and their
importance.
■
8. B. Locking cabinets and drawers is the best solution because
they allow individuals to lock their drawers and ensure that
access to a single key does not allow broad access to documents
like a department door lock or proximity cards for the space.
Onboarding is the process of adding an employee to a company’s
identity and access management system and would not help
with securing documents, but it might teach the process of doing
so.
■
9. D. Quantitative risk assessment is the process of assigning
numerical values to the probability an event will occur and what
the impact of the event will have. Change management is the
process of managing configuration changes made to a network.
Vulnerability assessment attempts to identify, quantify, and
rank the weaknesses in a system. Qualitative risk assessment is
the process of ranking which risk poses the most danger using
ratings like low, medium, and high.
■
10. D. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a type of
agreement that is usually not legally binding. This agreement is
intended to be mutually beneficial without involving courts or
money. An SLA (service level agreement) defines the level of
service the customer expects from the service provider. The level
of service definitions should be specific and measurable in each
area. A BPA (business partnership agreement) is a legal
agreement between partners. It establishes the terms,
conditions, and expectations of the relationship between the
partners. An ISA (interconnection security agreement) is an
agreement that specifies the technical and security requirements
of the interconnection between organizations.
■
11. A. Escalation is necessary in cases where the current breach
goes beyond the scope of the organization or investigators or is
required by law. In this case, Sally believes a crime has been
committed and has escalated the case to law enforcement. Other
escalations might be to federal or state law enforcement, or to
other more capable internal or external investigators.
Tokenizing data uses a deidentified replacement data item,
public notification notifies the population or customers at large,
and outsourcing investigations may be done if specialized skills
are needed.
■
12. A. The single loss expectancy (SLE) is the product of the value
($16,000) and the exposure factor (.35), or $5,600.
13. C. Antivirus is an example of a corrective control. A corrective
control is designed to correct a situation. An IDS (intrusion
detection system) is a detective control because it detects
security breaches. An audit log is a detective control because it
detects security breaches. A router is a preventive control
because it prevents security breaches with access control lists
(ACLs).
■
14. A. A deterrent control is used to warn a potential attacker not
to attack. Lighting added to the perimeter and warning signs
such as a “no trespassing” sign are deterrent controls. The other
options are examples of detective controls. A detective control is
designed to uncover a violation, although some detective
controls may serve as a deterrent—for example, when a camera
is visible, they are not primarily deterrent controls.
■
15. D. Testing and training are preventive administrative controls.
Administrative controls dictate how security policies should be
executed to accomplish the company’s security goals. A detective
technical control uncovers a violation through technology. A
preventive technical control attempts to stop a violation through
technology. Detective administrative controls uncover a
violation through policies, procedures, and guidelines.
■
16. A. Risk acceptance is a strategy of recognizing, identifying, and
accepting a risk that is sufficiently unlikely or that has such
limited impact that a corrective control is not warranted. Risk
transfer is the act of moving the risk to hosted providers who
assume the responsibility for recovery and restoration or by
acquiring insurance to cover the costs emerging from a risk. Risk
avoidance is the removal of the vulnerability that can increase a
particular risk so that it is avoided altogether. Risk mitigation is
when a company implements controls to reduce vulnerabilities
or weaknesses in a system. It can also reduce the impact of a
threat.
■
17. D. In most cases, operating a facility in a state is sufficient
reason to need to comply with state laws. Jim should check with
a lawyer, but he should plan on needing to comply with Illinois,
Indiana, and Ohio law, as well as federal laws.
■
18. A. Onboarding is the process of adding an employee to a
company’s identity and access management system. Offboarding
is the process of removing an employee from the company’s
identity and access management system. Adverse action is an
official personnel action that is taken for disciplinary reasons.
Job rotation gives individuals the ability to see various parts of
the organization and how it operates. It also eliminates the need
for a company to rely on one individual for security expertise
should the employee become disgruntled and decide to harm the
company. Recovering from a disgruntled employee’s attack is
easier when multiple employees understand the company’s
security posture.
■
19. A. A clean desk policy ensures that sensitive information and
documents are not left on desks after hours and requires
employees to place those files into a less exposed or secure
location. Background checks, continuing education, and job
rotation do not protect confidential information left on desks
from being exposed.
■
20. A. As users register for an account, they enter letters and
numbers they are given on the web page before they can register.
This is an example of a deterrent control since it prevents bots
from registering and proves this is a real person. Detective
controls detect intrusion as it happens and uncovers a violation.
A compensating control is used to satisfy a requirement for a
security measure that is too difficult or impractical to implement
at the current time. Degaussing is a method of removing data
from a magnetic storage media by changing the magnetic field.
■
21. D. A parking policy generally outlines parking provisions for
employees and visitors. This includes the criteria and
procedures for allocating parking spaces for employees and is
not a part of organizational security policy. Instead, it is an
operational or business policy. An acceptable use policy
describes the limits and guidelines for users to make use of an
organization’s physical and intellectual resources. This includes
allowing or limiting the use of personal email during work
hours. Social media policy defines how employees should use
social media networks and applications such as Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, and others. It can adversely affect a
company’s reputation. Password policies define the complexity
of creating passwords. It should also define weak passwords and
how users should protect password safety.
■
22. C. Proprietary data is a form of confidential information, and if
the information is revealed, it can have severe effects on the
company’s competitive edge. High is a generic label assigned to
data internally that represents the amount of risk being exposed
outside the company. The top-secret label is often used in
governmental systems where data and access may be granted or
denied based on assigned categories. Low is a generic label
assigned to data internally that represents the amount of risk
being exposed outside the company.
■
23. C. Antivirus software is used to protect computer systems from
malware and is not a physical security control. Physical controls
are security measures put in place to reduce the risk of harm
coming to a physical property. This includes protection of
personnel, hardware, software, networks, and data from
physical actions and events that could cause damage or loss.
■
24. A. Quantitative risk assessment is the process of assigning
numerical values to the probability an event will occur and what
impact the event will have. Qualitative risk assessment is the
process of ranking which risk poses the most danger such as
low, medium, and high. A business impact analysis (BIA) is used
to evaluate the possible effect a business can suffer should an
interruption to critical system operations occur. This
interruption could be as a result of an accident, emergency, or
disaster. Threat assessment is the process of identifying and
categorizing different threats such as environmental and
person-made. It also attempts to identify the potential impact
from the threats.
■
25. D. A nondisclosure agreement (NDA) protects sensitive and
intellectual data from getting into the wrong hands. An NDA is a
legal contract between the company and third-party vendor to
not disclose information per the agreement. Encrypted data that
is sent can still be decrypted by the third-party vendor if they
have the appropriate certificate or the key but does not restrict
access to the data. Violating an NDA would constitute
unauthorized data sharing, and a violation of privileged user
role-based awareness training has nothing to do with sharing
proprietary information.
■
26. A. Detective controls like CCTV detect intrusion as it happens
and can help uncover violations. Policies are administrative
controls. Firewalls and intrusion prevention system (IPS)
devices are technical controls. Technical controls are applied
through technology and may be also be deterrent, preventive,
detective, or compensating.
■
27. C. Sharing of profits and losses and the addition or removal of a
partner, as well as the responsibilities of each partner, are
typically included in a BPA (business partner agreement).
Expectations between parties such as a company and an Internet
service provider are typically found in a service level agreement
(SLA). Expectations include the level of performance given
during the contractual service. An SLA will provide a clear
means of determining whether a specific function or service has
been provided according to the agreed-on level of performance.
Security requirements associated with interconnecting IT
systems are typically found in an interconnection security
agreement, or ICA.
■
28. D. A backup generator is a compensating control—an alternate
control that replaces the original control when it cannot be used
due to limitations of the environment. A firewall is considered a
preventive control, a security guard is considered a physical
control, and an IDS (intrusion detection system) is considered a
detective control.
■
29. A. Preventive controls stop an action from happening—in this
scenario, preventing an unauthorized user from gaining access
to the network when the user steps away. A corrective control is
designed to correct a situation, a deterrent control is used to
deter a security breach, and a detective control is designed to
uncover a violation.
■
30. C. Job rotation allows individuals to see various parts of the
organization and how it operates. It also eliminates the need for
a company to rely on one individual for security expertise should
the employee become disgruntled and decide to harm the
company.
Recovering from a disgruntled employee’s attack is easier when
multiple employees understand the company’s security posture.
Separation of duties is the concept of having more than one
person required to complete a task, allowing problems to be
noted by others involved. A mandatory vacation policy is used by
companies to detect fraud by having a second person, familiar
with the duties, help discover any illicit activities while the
person who normally performs them is out of the office.
Onboarding is the process of adding an employee to a company’s
identity and access management system or other infrastructure.
■
31. B. Data minimization is the process of ensuring that only data
that is required for business functions is collected and
maintained. Tony should ensure that his organization is
minimizing the data collected. Data masking redacts data but
does not decrease how much is collected. Tokenization replaces
sensitive values with a unique identifier that can be looked up in
a lookup table. Anonymization removes the ability to identify
individuals from data but is quite difficult.
■
32. A. Risk avoidance is a strategy to deflect threats in order to
avoid the costly and disruptive consequences of a damaging
event. It also attempts to minimize vulnerabilities that can pose
a threat. A risk register is a document that tracks an
organization’s risks and information about the risks like who
owns it, if it is being remediated, and similar details. Risk
acceptance is a strategy of recognizing, identifying, and
accepting a risk that is sufficiently unlikely or that has such
limited impact that a corrective control is not warranted. Risk
mitigation is when a company implements controls to reduce
vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a system. It can also reduce the
impact of a threat.
■
33. D. Systems should be restored within four hours with a
minimum loss of one day’s worth of data. The RTO (recovery
time objective) is the amount of time within which a process or
service must be restored after a disaster to meet business
continuity. It defines how much time it takes to recover after
notification of process disruption. The recovery point objective,
or RPO, specifies the amount of time that can pass before the
amount of data lost may exceed the organization’s maximum
tolerance for data loss.
■
34. A. A data retention policy defines how long an organization will
keep data. Removing sensitive documents not in use is a clean
desk policy. A formal process for managing configuration
changes is change management, and a memorandum of
understanding consists of legal documents that describe mutual
agreement between two parties.
■
35. B. ALE (annual loss expectancy) is the product of the ARO
(annual rate of occurrence) and the SLE (single loss expectancy)
and is mathematically expressed as ALE = ARO × SLE. Single
loss expectancy is the cost of any single loss, and it is
mathematically expressed as SLE = AV (asset value) × EF
(exposure factor).
■
36. B. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks provide
recommendations for how to secure an operating system,
application, or other covered technology. Michelle will find
Windows 10–specific security configuration guidelines and
techniques.
■
37. A. Preventive controls like data backups are proactive and are
used to avoid a security breach or an interruption of critical
services before they can happen. Security cameras, smoke
detectors, and door alarms are examples of detective control.
Detective controls detect intrusion as it happens and uncovers a
violation.
■
38. C. Risk transfer is the act of moving the risk to hosted providers
who assume the responsibility for recovery and restoration or by
acquiring insurance to cover the costs emerging from a risk. Risk
acceptance is a strategy of recognizing, identifying, and
accepting a risk that is sufficiently unlikely or that has such
limited impact that a corrective control is not warranted. Risk
mitigation is when a company implements controls to reduce
vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a system. It can also reduce the
impact of a threat. Risk avoidance is the removal of the
vulnerability that can increase a particular risk so that it is
avoided altogether.
■
39. D. A preventive control is used to avoid a security breach or an
interruption of critical services before they can happen.
Administrative controls are defined through policies,
procedures, and guidelines. A compensating control is used to
satisfy a requirement for a security measure that is too difficult
or impractical to implement at the current time. A deterrent
control is used to deter a security breach.
■
40. C. Mean time between failures (MTBF) is a measurement to
show how reliable a hardware component is. MTTR (mean time
to repair) is the average time it takes for a failed device or
component to be repaired or replaced. An RPO (recovery point
objective) is the period of time a company can tolerate lost data
being unrecoverable between backups. ALE (annual loss
expectancy) is the product of the annual rate of occurrence
(ARO) and the single loss expectancy (SLE).
■
41. C. A single point of failure (SPOF) is a single weakness that can
bring an entire system down and prevent it from working. Cloud
computing allows the delivery of hosted service over the
Internet. Load balancing spreads traffic or other load between
multiple systems or servers. Virtualization uses a system to host
virtual machines that share the underlying resources such as
RAM, hard drive, and CPU.
■
42. A. Quantitative risk analysis requires complex calculations and
is more time-consuming because it requires detailed financial
data and calculations. Quantitative risk assessment is often
subjective and requires expertise on systems and infrastructure,
and both types of assessment can provide clear answers on riskbased
questions.
■
43. D. A custodian configures data protection based on security
policies. The local community bank is the data owner, not Leigh
Ann. Leigh Ann is a network administrator, not a user, and
power user is not a standard security role in the industry.
■
44. B. Risk acceptance is a strategy of recognizing, identifying, and
accepting a risk that is sufficiently unlikely or has such limited
impact that a corrective control is not warranted. Risk
mitigation is when a company implements controls to reduce
vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a system. It can also reduce the
impact of a threat. Risk avoidance is the removal of the
vulnerability that can increase a particular risk so that it is
avoided altogether. Risk transfer is the act of moving the risk to
other organizations like insurance providers or hosting
companies who assume the responsibility for recovery and
restoration or by acquiring insurance to cover the costs
emerging from a risk.
■
45. A. Data owners assign labels such as top secret to data.
Custodians assign security controls to data. A privacy officer
ensures that companies comply with privacy laws and
regulations. System administrators are responsible for the
overall functioning of IT systems.
■
46. C. Employees can leak a company’s confidential information.
Exposing a company’s information could put the company’s
security position at risk because attackers can use this
information as part of attacks against the company. Gaining
access to a computer’s MAC address is not relevant to social
media network risk. Gaining access to a computer’s IP address is
not relevant to social media network risk. Employees can easily
express their concerns about a company in general. This is not
relevant to social media network risk as long as the employee
doesn’t reveal any confidential information.
■
47. C. Separation of duties is the concept of having more than one
person required to complete a task. A background check is a
process that is performed when a potential employee is
considered for hire. Job rotation allows individuals to see
various parts of the organization and how it operates. It also
eliminates the need for a company to rely on one individual for
security expertise should the employee become disgruntled and
decide to harm the company. Recovering from a disgruntled
employee’s attack is easier when multiple employees understand
the company’s security posture. Collusion is an agreement
between two or more parties to defraud a person of their rights
or to obtain something that is prohibited by law.
■
48. B. ALE (annual loss expectancy) = SLE (single loss expectancy)
× ARO (annualized rate of occurrence). SLE equals $750,000
(2,500 records × $300), and ARO equals 5%, so $750,000 times
5% equals $37,500.
■
49. C. RPO (recovery point objective) specifies the allowable data
loss. It is the amount of time that can pass during an
interruption before the quantity of data lost during that period
surpasses business continuity planning’s maximum acceptable
threshold. MTBF (mean time between failures) is the rating on a
device or component that predicts the expected time between
failures. MTTR (mean time to repair) is the average time it takes
for a failed device or component to be repaired or replaced. ARO
(annual rate of occurrence) is the ratio of an estimated
possibility that a threat will take place within a one-year time
frame.
■
50. D. A data retention policy states how data should be stored
based on various types, such as storage location, amount of time
the data should be retained, and the type of storage medium that
should be used. A clean desk policy ensures that all
sensitive/confidential documents are removed from an end-user
workstation and locked up when the documents are not in use.
An AUP, or acceptable use policy, describes the limits and
guidelines for users to make use of an organization’s physical
and intellectual resources. This includes allowing or limiting the
use of personal email during work hours. A security policy
defines how to secure physical and information technology
assets. This document should be continuously updated as
technology and employee requirements change.
■
51. C. Onboarding is the process of adding an employee to
company’s identity and access management system. Offboarding
is the process of removing an employee from the company’s
identity and access management system. A system owner is an
individual who is in charge of managing one or more systems
and can include patching and updating operating systems. An
executive user was made up for this question.
■
52. B. Separation of duty can be classified as an operational control
that attempts to minimize fraud by ensuring that an individual
cannot exploit a process and conceal the errors or issues that
they are creating. It is not a physical control or a technical
control, and nothing in the question indicates that this is
compensating for gaps left by another control.
■
53. D. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not
include a right to anonymity, although organizations must be
able to provide security safeguards that may include
anonymization where appropriate.
■
54. D. The NIST RMF’s process is.
1. Prepare
2. Categorize system
3. Select controls
4. Implement controls
5. Assess controls
6. Authorize system
7. Monitor controls
■
55. B. Security program administrators often use different types of
training to ensure that trainees who react and respond
differently to training are given training that helps them. There
may be other valid reasons, but this is the most common reason
for training diversity.
■
56. A. Risks that the organization itself creates are internal risks.
External risks are those created by factors outside the
organization’s control. Qualitative and quantitative are both
types of risk assessment, rather than categorizations of risk.
■
57. B. Risk registers are documents used by organizations to track
and manage risks and include information including the owner
or responsible party, details about the risk, and other useful
information. Statement on Standards for Attestation
Engagements (SSAEs) are audit reports, Payment Card Industry
Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is a security standard used
for credit card operations, and risk table is not a common
industry term.
■
58. C. The mean time to repair (MTTR) for a system or devices is
the average time that it will take to repair it if it fails. The MTTR
is used as part of business continuity planning to determine if a
system needs additional redundancy or other options put in
place if a failure and repair would exceed the maximum
tolerable outage. It is calculated by dividing the total
maintenance time by the total number of repairs. MTBF is the
mean time between failures, MTTF the mean time to fail, and
MITM is an on-path attack, a term that has been increasingly
replaced with on-path.
■
59. D. Common results of breaches like this include identity theft
using the personal information of the customers, financial loss
to the company due to breach costs and lawsuits, and
reputational loss. Since the incident response process is over,
Olivia’s company should have remediated the underlying issues
that led to the breach, hopefully preventing further downtime
and thus availability loss.
■
60. D. There is no civilian classification level for government data.
Data may be unclassified, or sensitive but unclassified. Top
Secret, Secret, and Confidential are all commonly used
classifications.
■
61. B. The source code for a product is not typically used as a
location for privacy terms and conditions. Instead, they are in
the contract, user license or related legal terms, or in a formal
privacy notice.
■
62. B. Pseudonymization can allow reidentification of the data
subject if additional data is available. Properly done
anonymization cannot be reversed. Anonymization techniques
will group information so that individuals cannot be identified
from data and use other techniques to prevent additional
information, leading to de-anonymization of individuals.
■
63. A. A data governance policy clearly states who owns the
information collected and used by an organization. Information
security policies provide the high-level authority and guidance
for security programs and efforts. Acceptable use policies
(AUPs) define what information resources can be used for and
how. Data retention policies establish what information an
organization will collect and how long it will be kept before
destruction.
■
64. C. Helen has created a functional recovery plan focused on a
specific technical and business function. A disaster recovery
plan (DRP) has a broader perspective and might include
multiple functional recovery plans. RPOs, or recovery point
objectives, and MTBF, or mean time between failures, are not
types of plans typically built by organizations.
■
65. B. Health information may be covered by state, local, or federal
law, and Greg’s organization should ensure that they understand
any applicable laws before storing, processing, or handling
health information.
■
66. C. Control risks specifically apply to financial information,
where they may impact the integrity or availability of the
financial information.
■
67. D. An individual is most likely to face identity theft issues if
their personally identifiable information (PII) is stolen or
breached.
■
68. C. It is common practice to prohibit interactive logins to a GUI
or shell for service accounts. Use of a service account for
interactive logins or attempting to log in as one should be
immediately flagged and alerted on as an indicator of
compromise (IoC).
■
69. C. Asset management policies typically include all stages of an
asset’s life cycle, and asset tags like those described are used to
track assets in many organizations. Change management,
incident response, and acceptable use policies do not require
asset tagging.
■
70. D. The diagram shows a fully redundant internal network with
pairs of firewalls, routers, and core switches, but with a single
connection to the Internet. This means that Megan should
consider how her organization would connect to the outside
world if that link was severed or disrupted. There is no
indication whether this is a wired or wireless link, and the image
does not show a redundant link.
■
71. D. Emma should categorize this as a supply chain risk. When
organizations cannot get the systems, equipment, and supplies
they need to operate, it can have significant impact on their
ability to conduct business. That could create financial risk, but
financial risk is not the direct risk here. There is no indication
that the vendor will not support the systems, nor is there any
information about whether there is an integration issue in the
description.
■
72. A. An intrusion detection system (IDS) can detect attacks, and
is a detective control. Since it is a technical system rather than a
physical control or an administrative policy or procedure, Henry
can correctly categorize it as a technical, detective control.
■
73. C. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) does not provide
security configuration guides or benchmarks for operating
systems or devices. The Center for Internet Security (CIS),
Microsoft (and other vendors), and the National Security Agency
(NSA) all provide configuration benchmarks.
■
74. C. Legacy systems that no longer receive support are a
significant concern because they cannot be patched if security
vulnerabilities are discovered. Windows 2008 reached its end of
life in January 2020. It ran on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms,
and you can still install modern web servers on it.
■
75. B. Patching is a form of avoidance because it works to remove a
risk from the environment. Acceptance of flaws that need
patching would involve leaving the software unpatched;
mitigation strategies might include firewalls, intrusion
prevention systems (IPSs), or web application firewall (WAF)
devices; and transference options include third-party hosting or
services.
■
76. B. Risk heat maps or a risk matrix can allow an organization to
quickly look at risks and compare them based on their
probability and impact or other rating elements. Qualitative and
quantitative risk assessments are types of assessment, not
means of presenting risk information in an easy-to-understand
format, and risk plots are not a common term used in the field.
■
77. A. The fines that can result from violation or infringement of
regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation can
have a significant impact on an organization, or could even
potentially put it out of business. Due to this, organizations will
track compliance with regulations as part of their risk posture.
■
78. D. Disaster recovery requires forethought and preparation,
response to issues to minimize impact during a disaster, and
response activities after a disaster. Thus, a complete disaster
recovery plan should include actions that may or will occur
before, during, and after a disaster, and not just the recovery
process after the fact.
■
79. B. Although data breaches could result in termination of a card
processing agreement, the fact that her organization is
noncompliant is most likely to result in a fine. PCI-DSS, or
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is a vendor
standard, not a law, and criminal charges would not typically be
filed in a situation like this.
■
80. C. The Cloud Security Alliance’s Cloud Control Matrix maps
existing standards to common control descriptions allowing
control requirements to be compared and validated across many
standards and regulations. The CSA reference architecture is a
set of standard designs, and ISO 27001 and ISO 27002 are
standards for managing information security.
■
81. B. Gamification makes training into a game to get more
involvement and interest. Scoring points and receiving rewards,
either in-game or virtually, can have a significant positive
impact on the response to training. Capture-the-flag events
focus on techniques like finding hidden information or
otherwise obtaining “flags” as part of a contest. Phishing
campaigns send fake phishing emails to staff to identify
individuals who may fall for them. Role-based training focuses
on training specifically for the role or job that an individual has
or will have.
■
82. D. The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, requires
a data protection officer (DPO). They oversee the organization’s
data protection strategy and implementation, and make sure
that the organization complies with the GDPR.
■
83. D. Although recovering from a breach can be costly, the loss of
data like intellectual property in circumstances like these is the
most critical issue. The institution is likely to suffer reputational
harm and may not be trusted to conduct research like this in the
future, leading to an even greater cost to the university’s ability
to do new research with the government.
■
84. B. Mission-essential functions are defined as those functions
that an organization must run throughout a disaster or that
must be resumed as quickly as possible after one if they cannot
be sustained. They are the core functions of the organization and
are key to its success and ongoing existence. A single point of
failure (SPOF) is a point where a device, system, or resource can
fail and cause an entire function or organization to no longer
work. Recovery time objectives (RTOs) are the time allotted to
return to normal functionality. Core recovery functions were
made up for this question.
■
85. B. A SLA (service level agreement) defines the level of service
the customer expects from the service provider. The level of
service definitions should be specific and measurable in each
area. An MOU (memorandum of understanding) is a legal
document that describes a mutual agreement between parties.
An ISA (interconnection security agreement) is an agreement
that specifies the technical and security requirements of the
interconnection between organizations. A BPA (business
partnership agreement) is a legal agreement between partners.
It establishes the terms, conditions, and expectations of the
relationship between the partners.
■
86. A. Customer data can include any information that a customer
uploads, shares, or otherwise places in or creates via a service.
Customers may have contractual security guarantees in the
terms of service, and notification or other clauses may also
impact what Rick needs to do if the data is breached. PII is
personally identifiable information like name, address, or other
details that can identify a person. Financial information may
include bills, account balances, and similar details. Health
information covers a broad range of data about an individual’s
medical and health status or history.
■
87. C. Theft of proprietary information like a formula or code is an
example of intellectual property (IP) theft. IP theft can be harder
to quantify the cost of a loss in many cases but can have
significant impact to an organization that relies on the IP for
their business. External risk is risk created by factors outside the
organization, internal risk is created by the organization itself or
its decisions, and licensing risk exists through software and
other contracts.
■
88. B. This is an example of a personnel credential policy since it
applies to the staff who are employed by his organization.
Policies like this help to ensure that accounts are not shared or
reused. There is no mention of specific devices, service accounts,
or administrative accounts.
■
89. C. The likelihood of occurrence, or probability, is multiplied by
the impact to determine a risk’s severity.
■
90. D. Organizations can determine how they want to determine
asset value, but consistency is important in many cases. Thus,
the original cost, the replacement cost, or a depreciated cost may
be used.
■
91. A. A business impact analysis (BIA) helps to identify critical
systems by determining which systems will create the largest
impact if they are not available. MTBF is the mean time between
failures, an RTO is a recovery time objective, and an ICD was
made up for this question.
■
92. D. The most common means of transferring breach risk is to
purchase cybersecurity insurance. Accepting breaches is rarely
considered a valid risk process, blaming breaches on
competitors does not actually transfer risk, and selling data to
another organization is not a risk handling process but may be a
business process.
■
93. B. Service accounts are not typically allowed to use interactive
logins, and thus prohibiting interactive logins is a common
security policy for them. Limited login hours or locations are
more commonly used for employee accounts when they should
not be accessing resources after hours or from nonwork
locations. Frequent password expiration for service accounts is
actually likely to cause a service outage, and many service
accounts have complex passwords and are set with longer
password expiration timeframes or are set to never expire.
■
94. C. The cost of a breach is an example of the impact of a breach.
Probability is how likely the risk is to occur, and risk severity is
calculated by multiplying probability and impact.
■
95. B. Sean is conducting a site risk assessment that will help him
understand and communicate the risks that the site itself has. If
the location is in a FEMA-identified flood plain, or if there are
concerns about tornadoes or other natural disasters, those need
to be taken into account as the organization makes its decisions
about the location. A BIA identifies mission-critical functions
and the systems that support them. Crime prevention through
environmental design is a design concept that uses the design of
facilities to reduce the likelihood of criminal actions through use
of lighting and other controls. Business continuity planning
focuses on how to keep an organization operating despite
disruptions.
■
96. D. SOC 2 engagement assesses the security and privacy
controls that are in place, and a Type 2 report provides
information on the auditor’s assessment of the effectiveness of
the controls that are in place. An SOC 1 report assesses the
controls that impact the accuracy of financial reporting. Type 1
reports a review auditor’s opinion of the description provided by
management about the suitability of the controls as designed.
They do not look at the actual operating effectiveness of the
controls.
■
97. B. Ensuring that leadership throughout an organization is
aware of the risks the organization faces and that they are
regularly updating and providing feedback on those risks helps
increase risk awareness. Inherent risk is risk that exists before
controls are in place, and residual risk is risk that remains after
controls are in place. Risk appetite is the risk that an
organization is willing to take as part of doing business.
■
98. C. State laws often include breach notification thresholds and
requirements that organizations must follow. Laura should
ensure that she is both aware of the breach laws for her state and
any other states or countries her company operates in, and that
her incident response plans have appropriate processes in place
if a breach occurs. Organizations that process data like SSNs are
unlikely to delete them even if a breach occurs, reclassifying data
would not help unless the data was improperly classified before
the breach, and data minimization plans are used to limit how
much data an organization has, not to respond to a breach
directly.
■
99. C. Nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) are signed by an
employee at the time of hiring, and they impose a contractual
obligation on employees to maintain the confidentiality of
information. Disclosure of information can lead to legal
ramifications and penalties. NDAs cannot ensure a decrease in
security breaches. A job rotation policy is the practice of moving
employees between different tasks to promote experience and
variety. Separation of ties has more than one person required to
complete a task. Mandatory vacation policy is used by
companies to detect fraud by having a second person, familiar
with the duties, help discover any illicit activities.
■
100. B. Olivia should establish a service level agreement (SLA) with
her provider to ensure that they meet the expected level of
service. If they don’t, financial or other penalties are typically
included. Olivia should ensure that those penalties are
meaningful to her vendor to make sure they are motivated to
meet the SLA. An MOU is a memorandum of understanding and
explains the relationship between two organizations; an MSA is
a master services agreement, which establishes a business
relationship under which additional work orders or other
documentation describe the actual work that is done; and a BPA
is a business partnership agreement, which is used when
companies wish to partner on efforts and may outline division of
profits or responsibilities in the partnership.
■
101. D. The most accurate risk descriptor for this is software
compliance. Although this is an internal risk, software
compliance fully describes the issue. Intellectual property (IP)
theft risk occurs when an organization’s intellectual property is
stolen, not when license violations for third parties occurs. This
is not a legacy system, or at least it was not described that way in
the question.
■
102. D. Inherent risk is the risk that an organization faces before
controls are put in place. Without risk assessment and controls
in place, Gary must first deal with the inherent risks the
organization has as it exists today. Residual risk is the risk that
is left after controls are put in place. The theft of intellectual
property (IP) like algorithms, formulas, and processes are IP
risks, and multiparty risk is risk that impacts more than one
group, company, or person.
■
103. A. The single loss expectancy (SLE) describes what a single risk
event is likely to cost. It is calculated using the asset value (AV)
times the exposure factor (EF), which is an estimated percentage
of the cost that will occur in damage if the loss occurs. MTTR is
the mean time to restore, ARO is the annual rate of occurrence,
and RTO is the recovery time objective. These are not part of the
SLE equation.
■
104. C. Third-party credential policies address how contractors and
consultants credentials are handled. This may require
sponsorship by an internal staff member, additional controls
regarding password resets or changes, and shorter lifespans,
among other controls and requirements.
105. B. Annual rate of occurrence (ARO) is expressed as the number
of times an event will occur in a year. Wayne has estimated that
the risk event that is being assessed will happen three times a
year.
■
106. D. Although humans can create fires or floods, industrial
accidents are the only item on the list that are exclusively
person-made disasters.
■
107. C. Information on a website made available to customers is
typically classified as public information because it is easily
available and intentionally exposed to them. Confidential,
sensitive, or critical information is unlikely to be exposed to
customers without a specific data handling agreement and
additional security layers.
■
108. D. Data processors are service providers that process data for
data controllers. A data controller or data owner is the
organization or individual who collects and controls data. A data
steward carries out the intent of the data controller and is
delegated responsibility for the data. Data custodians are those
who are entrusted with the data to store, manage, or secure the
data.
■
109. D. Data masking partially redacts sensitive data by replacing
some or all information in a sensitive data field with blanks or
other replacement characters. Tokenization replaces sensitive
data with unique identifiers using a lookup table. Hashing
performs a one-way function on a value to get a unique hash,
and encryption protects data using an algorithm that can be
reversed to restore the original data while allowing for
confidentiality and integrity validation.
■
110. C. The Cloud Security Alliance’s reference architecture includes
information about tools in a vendor-neutral manner. CIS
provides vendor specific benchmarks for AWS, Azure, and
Oracle’s cloud offerings. The International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) do not offer this type of resource.
■
111. C. Locks are physical controls. An example of a managerial
control would be a policy or practice, a technical control can
include things like firewalls or antivirus, and corrective controls
are put in place to ensure that a problem or gap in another
control is fixed.
■
112. C. Control risk is a term used in public accounting. It is the risk
that arises from a potential lack of internal controls within an
organization that may cause a material misstatement in the
organization’s financial reports. In this case, the lack of controls
that would validate the financial system’s data and function is a
control risk.
■
113. C. Although fires, oil spills, and wars are all potential examples
of person-made disasters, hurricanes remain solely a natural
disaster. Some disasters could be either a person-made or
natural disaster. For example, fires can be caused by humans or
by nature, as can floods, and even chemical spills when an
earthquake occurs.
■
114. C. Confidential information is classified by the U.S.
government as information that requires some protection and
that if disclosed without authorization, would cause identifiable
harm to national security. Top Secret information requires the
highest degree of protection and would cause exceptionally
grave harm if exposed without authorization. Secret information
requires a substantial degree of protection and would cause
serious damage if exposed. Business Sensitive is not a U.S.
government classification but is a term commonly used in
businesses.
■
115. C. Phone numbers uniquely identify individuals, making them
an example of personally identifiable information, or PII. PHI is
protected health information, financial information includes
financial records of all types, and government information is
information that belongs to the government or may be classified
by the government and entrusted to an organization.
■
116. B. Tokenization is an ideal option for this scenario.
Tokenization replaces a sensitive value with an alternate value
that can be looked up in a table when the value needs to be
referenced back to its original form. Encryption does not meet
this need, data masking only hides part of the value, and data
washing is not a commonly used term for techniques of this
nature.
■
117. C. Privacy notices are often included on websites to meet the
requirements of laws or regulations like the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) or state privacy laws.
■
118. C. Nicole is a data controller, sometimes called a data owner.
She determines the reasons for processing personal information
and how it is processed. A data steward carries out the intents of
the data controller, data custodians are charged with
safeguarding information, and data consumer is not a common
data privacy role.
■
119. B. This is an internal disaster—one in which internal issues
have led to a problem. An external disaster would be caused by
forces outside the organization like a natural disaster, malicious
activity, or other outside forces. An RTO, or recovery time
objective, is not a type of disaster, and an MRO disaster was
made up for this question.
■
120. C. Minimizing the amount of data that is collected is the first
step in ensuring that organizations can handle the volume and
types of data that they work with. After that, classifying it and
then determining how long you retain it are also important parts
of the data life cycle.
■
121. D. Kirk has mitigated the risk to his organization by increasing
the resources targeted by the DoS attack in an attempt to ensure
that the attack will not be successful. Acceptance would involve
simply letting the attacks occur knowing they are likely to stop,
avoidance might involve finding a way to ensure the attacks
cannot occur, and transfer could leverage a third-party mirror or
anti-DoS hosting service.
■
122. A. A multiparty risk involves multiple organizations. Since
there are multiple customers and organizations involved, this is
an example of multiparty risk. An internal risk originates inside
an organization—instead, this is an external risk. A legacy
system risk is created by a system or process that is no longer
supported or updated. An intellectual property (IP) theft risk
occurs when proprietary information or trade secrets might be
exposed or lost.
■
123. B. EOL, or end of life, occurs when a service or system is no
longer supported, available, or does not function. Natasha needs
to plan to transition smoothly away from the service, either to a
replacement service or to stop using the service itself. An MOU
is a memorandum of understanding, and an NDA is a
nondisclosure agreement, neither of which is directly relevant
here. A last will and testament is not used for a service EOL.
■
124. C. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides a wide range
of OS, application, server, and other benchmarks. Microsoft
provides benchmarks for their own operating systems but does
not provide Linux benchmarks. The National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) does not provide
benchmarks, but the National Security Agency (NSA) does.
■
125. C. Offboarding processes are conducted to ensure that accounts
and access is removed and that materials, computers, and data
are all recovered from the staff member when a member of an
organization leaves. Exit interviews are an HR process, job
rotation helps to prevent an individual from conducting
fraudulent activities over time, and governance helps to manage
and maintain data by establishing high level control over the
processes, procedures, and classification of the data an
organization uses.
■
126. D. Public, private, sensitive, confidential, critical, and
proprietary are all commonly used data classification labels for
business. Secret, however, is more commonly used in
government classification schemes.
■
127. D. Privacy notices are frequently provided as part of license or
contractual terms, as well as in website usage agreements.
