1. A. Dual control, which requires two individuals to perform a
function; split knowledge, which splits the passphrase or key
between two or more people; and separation of duties, which
ensures that a single individual does not control or oversee the
entire process all help prevent insider threats when managing a
PKI. Requiring a new passphrase when a certificate is used is
not a reasonable solution and would require reissuing the
certificate.
■
2. B. A site survey is the process of identifying where access points
should be located for best coverage and identifying existing
sources of RF interference, including preexisting wireless
networks and other devices that may use the same radio
frequency spectrum. By conducting a site survey, Naomi can
guide the placement of her access points as well as create a
channel design that will work best for her organization.
■
3. B. The option that best meets the needs described above is
PEAP, the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol. PEAP
relies on server-side certificates and relies on tunneling to
ensure communications security. EAP-MD5 is not
recommended for wireless networks and does not support
mutual authentication of the wireless client and network. LEAP,
the Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol, uses WEP
keys for its encryption and is not recommended due to security
issues. Finally, EAP-TLS, or EAP Transport Layer Security,
requires certificates on both the client and server, consuming
more management overhead.
■
4. C. East-west traffic is traffic sent laterally inside a network.
Some networks focus security tools at the edges or places where
networks interconnect, leaving internal, or east-west, traffic
open. In zero-trust environments, internal traffic is not
presumed to be trustworthy, reducing the risks of this type of
lateral communication. Side-stepping, slider traffic, and peer
interconnect were all made up for this question, although peer
interconnect may sound similar to peer-to-peer traffic, which
may be lateral in many networks.
■
5. C. Although preventing Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
(MIME) sniffing may sound humorous, MIME sniffing can be
used in cross-site scripting attacks, and the X-Content-Type-
Options header helps prevent MIME sniffing. HTTP securityoriented
headers can also set X-Frame options, turn on crosssite
scripting protection, set content security policies, and
require transport security. There isn’t a “Disable SQL injection”
header, however!
■
6. C. Mobile device management (MDM) suites often provide the
ability to manage content on devices as well as applications.
Using content management tools can allow Charlene to
provision files, documents, and media to the devices that staff
members in her organization are issued. Application
management would be useful for apps. Remote wipe can remove
data and applications from the device if it is lost or stolen, or an
employee leaves the organization. Push notifications are useful
when information needs to be provided to the device user.
■
7. C. In this scenario, Denny specifically needs to ensure that he
stops the most malware. In situations like this, vendor diversity
is the best way to detect more malware, and installing a different
vendor’s antivirus (AV) package on servers like email servers
and then installing a managed package for PCs will result in the
most detections in almost all cases. Installing more than one AV
package on the same system is rarely recommended, since this
often causes performance issues and conflicts between the
packages—in fact, at times AV packages have been known to
detect other AV packages because of the deep hooks they place
into the operating system to detect malicious activity!
■
8. B. Amanda has encountered a captive portal. Captive portals
redirect all traffic to the portal page, either to allow the portal to
collect information or to display the page itself. Once users have
completed the requirements that the portal puts in place, they
are permitted to browse the Internet. This may be accomplished
by assigning a new IP address or by allowing the connected IP
address to have access to the Internet using a firewall rule or
other similar method. Preshared keys are used in wireless
networks for authentication. Port security is used for wired
networks, and WPA stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access, as in
WPA, WPA-2, and WPA-3.
■
9. B. Domain Name System Security Extensions, or DNSSEC,
provides the ability to validate DNS data and denial of existence,
and provides data integrity for DNS. It does not provide
confidentiality or availability controls. If Charles needs to
provide those, he will have to implement additional controls.
■
10. B. Google is acting as an identity provider, or IdP. An IdP
creates and manages identities for federations. An RP is a
relying party, which relies on an identity provider. An SP is a
service provider, and an RA is a registration authority involved
in the process for providing cryptographic certificates.
■
11. C. SSH, or Secure Shell, is a secure protocol used to connect to
command-line shells. SSH can also be used to tunnel other
protocols, making it a useful and frequently used tool for system
administrators, security professionals, and attackers. Using
HTTPS or Transport Layer Security (TLS) for a secure command
line is rare, and Telnet is an insecure protocol.
■
12. B. Of the options provided, only FIDO U2F, an open standard
provided by the Fast IDentity Online Alliance, is a standard for
security keys. Other standards that you may encounter include
OTP (One Time Password), SmartCard, OATH-HOTP, and
OpenPGP. Of note, OATH, the Initiative for Open Authentiation
provides standards both HMAC-based one time password
(HOTP) and TOTP, or time-based one time passwords. SAML
(Security Assertion Markup Language) and OpenID are both
used in authentication processes but not for security keys. ARF
was made up for this question.
■
13. C. Nadia should use Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (S/MIME), which supports asymmetric encryption
and should then use Danielle’s public key to encrypt the email so
that only Danielle can decrypt the messages and read them.
Secure POP3 would protect messages while they’re being
downloaded but would not protect the content of the messages
between servers.
■
14. B. SRTP is a secure version of the Real-Time Transport
Protocol and is used primarily for Voice over IP (VoIP) and
multimedia streaming or broadcast. SRTP, as currently
implemented, does not fully protect packets, leaving RTP
headers exposed, potentially exposing information that might
provide attackers with information about the data being
transferred.
■
15. C. Olivia should make her organization aware that a failure in
one of the active nodes would result in less maximum
throughput and a potential for service degradation. Since
services are rarely run at maximum capacity, and many can have
maintenance windows scheduled, this does not mean that the
load balancers cannot be patched. There is nothing in this
design that makes the load balancers more vulnerable to denial
of service than they would be under any other design.
■
16. A. File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS) typically uses port 990
for implicit FTPS and port 21, the normal FTP command port, is
used for explicit FTPS. Port 22 is used for SSH, 433 was used for
the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), 1433 is used for
Microsoft SQL, and port 20 is used for FTP.
■
17. A. Certificate stapling allows the server that is presenting a
certificate to provide a more efficient way to check the
revocation status of the certificate via the Online Certificate
Status Protocol (OCSP) by including the OCSP response with the
handshake for the certificate. This provides both greater security
because clients know that the certificate is valid, and greater
efficiency because they don’t have to perform a separate
retrieval to check the certificate’s status. The rest of the options
were made up and are not certificate stapling.
■
18. B. A registration authority, or RA, receives requests for new
certificates as well as renewal requests for existing certificates.
They can also receive revocation requests and similar tasks. An
intermedia CA is trusted by the root CA to issue certificates. A
CRL is a certificate revocation list.
■
19. C. Least connection-based load balancing takes load into
consideration and sends the next request to the server with the
least number of active sessions. Round robin simply distributes
requests to each server in order, whereas weighted time uses
health checks to determine which server responds the most
quickly on an ongoing basis and then sends the traffic to that
server. Finally, source IP hashing uses the source and
destination IP addresses to generate a hash key and then uses
that key to track sessions, allowing interrupted sessions to be
reallocated to the same server and thus allowing the sessions to
continue.
■
20. A. IPSec’s Authentication Header (AH) protocol does not
provide data confidentiality because it secures only the header,
not the payload. That means that AH can provide integrity and
replay protection but leaves the rest of the data at risk. Matt
should note this and express concerns about why the VPN is not
using Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP).
■
21. C. Michelle knows that POP3 runs on port 110 by default, and
that TLS (via STARTTLS as an extension) allows POP3 clients to
request a secure connection without needing to use the alternate
port 995 used in some configurations. Port 25 is the default port
for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and IKE is used for
IPSec.
■
22. A. A cloud access security broker (CASB) is a software tool or
service that sits between an organization’s on-premises network
and a cloud provider’s infrastructure. A CASB acts as a
gatekeeper, allowing the organization to extend the reach of
their security policies into the cloud.
■
23. A. Angela’s company has deployed a version of Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) that doesn’t use Transport Layer
Security (TLS) to maintain confidentiality. She should switch to
a SIP Secure (SIPS) implementation to protect the
confidentiality of phone conversations. Vishing, or voice
phishing; war dialing, which attempts to map all numbers for a
phone service, typically to find modems; and denial of service
are all less likely on a VoIP network, although they could occur.
■
24. B. The fastest way for Alaina to implement secure transport for
her Network Time Protocol (NTP) traffic will typically be to
simply tunnel the traffic via Secure Shell (SSH) from the NTP
server to her Linux systems. An IPSec virtual private network
(VPN) between devices will typically take more work to set up
and maintain, although this could be scripted, and a Transport
Layer Security (TLS) VPN would require additional work since it
is intended for web traffic. RDP is the Remote Desktop Protocol
and is primarily used for Windows systems and would not be a
good choice. In most environments, however, NTP traffic does
not receive any special security, and NTP sources are trusted to
perform without exceptional security measures.
■
25. D. The safest and most secure answer is that Ramon should
simply implement TLS for the entire site. Although TLS does
introduce some overhead, modern systems can handle large
numbers of simultaneous TLS connections, making a secure
website an easy answer in almost all cases.
■
26. D. Although IP addresses for public servers and clients are not
typically considered sensitive, the usernames, passwords, and
files that the contractors use would be. Katie should consider
helping her organization transition to a secure FTP or other
service to protect her organization’s customers and the
organization itself.
■
27. D. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) sniffing or
snooping can be enabled to prevent rogue DHCP servers as well
as malicious or malformed DHCP traffic. It also allows the
capture and collection of DHCP binding information to let
network administrators know who is assigned what IP address.
■
28. B. Aaron can use a wildcard certificate to cover all the hosts
inside of a set of subdomains. Wildcards only cover a single level
of subdomain, however, so if he purchased *. example.com, he
could not use *. blog.example.com. A self-signed certificate will
cause errors for visitors and should not be used for production
purposes. Self-signed certificates will create errors in most
browsers and so are not used in production environments.
Extended validation (EV) certificates will not provide this
functionality, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is no longer in use
with the switch to TLS for security reasons.
■
29. D. Root Guard can be set on a per-port basis to protect ports
that will never be set up to be the root bridge for a VLAN. Since
this shouldn’t change regularly, it is safe to set for most ports in
a network. Spanning tree is used to prevent loops, so disabling
STP would actually make this problem more likely. Bridge IDs
cannot be negative, and BridgeProtect was made up for this
question.
■
30. C. A Personal Information Exchange (PFX) formatted file is a
binary format used to store server certificates, as well as
intermediary certificates, and it can also contain the server’s
private key. Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) files can contain
multiple PEM certificates and a private key, but most systems
store certificates and the key separately. Distinguished Encoding
Rules (DER) format files are frequently used with Java
platforms and can store all types of certificates and private keys.
P7B, or PKCS#7, formatted files can contain only certificates
and certificate chains, not private keys. For the exam, you
should also know that a CER is a file extension for an SSL
certificate file format used by web servers to help verify the
identity and security of the site in question. SSL certificates are
provided by a third-party security certificate authority such as
VeriSign, GlobalSign, or Thawte.
A P12 file contains a digital certificate that uses PKCS#12 (Public
Key Cryptography Standard #12) encryption. The P12 file
contains both the private and the public key, as well as
information about the owner (name, email address, etc.), all
being certified by a third party. With such a certificate, a user
can identify themselves and authenticate themselves to any
organization trusting the third party.
■
31. D. A firewall has two types of rules. One type is to allow specific
traffic on a given port. The other type of rule is to deny traffic.
What is shown here is a typical firewall rule. Options A, B, and C
are incorrect. The rule shown is clearly a firewall rule.
■
32. C. Many subscription services allow for data retrieval via
HTTPS. Ted can subscribe to one or more threat feeds or
reputation services, and then feed that information to an
intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system
(IPS), next -generation firewall, or similar network security tool.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used to make
assertions about identities and authorization, a VDI is a virtual
desktop environment, and FDE is full-disk encryption.
■
33. B. Secure cookies are HTTP cookies that have the secure flag
set, thus requiring them to only be sent via a secure channel like
HTTPS. They are not stored in encrypted form or hashed, and
cookie keys were made up for this question.
■
34. D. Unlike IPSec’s tunnel mode, IPSec transport mode allows
different policies per port. The IP addresses in the outer header
for transport mode packets are used to determine the policy
applied to the packet. IPSec doesn’t have a PSK mode, but WPA-
2 does. IKE is used to set up security associations in IPSec but
doesn’t allow this type of mode setting.
■
35. A. WPS personal identification numbers (PINs) were revealed
to be a problem in 2011, when a practical brute-force attack
against WPS PIN setup modes was demonstrated. WPS suffers
from a variety of other security issues and is not used for
enterprise security. WPS remains in use in home environments
for ease of setup.
■
36. C. The Online Certificate Status Protocol, or OCSP, is used to
determine the status of a certificate. RTCP, CRBL, and PKCRL
were all made up for this question.
■
37. C. Certificate revocation lists (CRLs) are designed specifically
for revoking certificates. Since public keys are distributed via
certificates, this is the most effective way to deauthorize a public
key. Option A is incorrect. Simply notifying users that a
key/certificate is no longer valid is not effective. Option B is
incorrect. Deleting a certificate is not always possible and
ignores the possibility of a duplicate of that certificate existing.
Option D is incorrect. The registration authority (RA) is used in
creating new certificates, not in revoking them.
■
38. C. Global Positioning System (GPS) data and data about local
Wi-Fi networks are the two most commonly used protocols to
help geofencing applications determine where they are. When a
known Wi-Fi signal is gained or lost, the geofencing application
knows it is within range of that network. GPS data is even more
useful because it can work in most locations and provide
accurate location data. Although Bluetooth is sometimes used
for geofencing, its limited range means that it is a third choice.
Cellular information would require accurate tower-based
triangulation, which means it is not typically used for geofencing
applications, and of course USB is a wired protocol.
■
39. A. The demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a zone between an outer
firewall and an inner firewall. It is specifically designed as a
place to locate public-facing servers. The outer firewall is more
permissive, thus allowing public access to the servers in the
DMZ. However, the inner firewall is more secure, thus
preventing outside access to the corporate network.
■
40. C. The first step in security is hardening the operating system,
and one of the most elementary aspects of that is turning off
unneeded services. This is true regardless of the operating
system. Although installing antimalware, implementing usage
policies, and setting password reuse policies are all good
practices, turning off unnecessary services is typically the first
step in securing a system.
■
41. C. Knowledge-based authentication requires information that
only the user is likely to know. Examples include things like
previous tax payments, bill amounts, and similar information.
Requesting a Social Security number is less secure and would
only work for users in the United States. Federated identity via
Google accounts does not meet this need because Google
accounts do not have a user validation requirement. Finally,
validation emails only prove that the user has access to an
account that they provide, not that they are a specific individual.
■
42. A. A Transport Layer Security (TLS) VPN is frequently chosen
when ease of use is important, and web applications are the
primary usage mode. IPSec VPNs are used for site-to-site VPNs
and for purposes where other protocols may be needed, because
they make the endpoint system appear to be on the remote
network.
■
43. A. Full-disk encryption (FDE) fully encrypts the hard drive on a
computer. This is an effective method for ensuring the security
of data on a computer. Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) are
store keys and are used for boot integrity and other
cryptographic needs and won’t directly protect the data.
Software-defined networking (SDN) is virtualized networking,
and demilitarized zones (DMZs) are used to segment a network
and won’t affect this problem.
■
44. A. A DMZ (demilitarized zone) provides limited access to
public-facing servers for outside users, but blocks outside users
from accessing systems inside the LAN. It is a common practice
to place web servers in the DMZ. A virtual LAN, or VLAN, is
most often used to segment the internal network, routers direct
traffic based on IP address, and a guest network allows internal
users who are not employees to get access to the Internet.
■
45. D. Identity attributes are characteristics of an identity,
including details like the individual’s birth date, age, job title,
address, or a multitude of other details about the identity. They
are used to differentiate the identity from others and may also
be used by the identity management system or connected
systems in coordination with the identity itself. Roles describe
the job or position an individual has in an organization, and
factors are something you know, something you have, or
something you are. Identifiers are not a common security or
authentication term, although identity is.
■
46. D. The CN, or common name, for a certificate for a system is
typically the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the server.
If Megan was requesting a certificate for herself, instead of for a
server, she would use her full name.
■
47. B. Physically portioning your network is the physical equivalent
of a virtual LAN, or VLAN. A VLAN is designed to emulate
physical partitioning. Perimeter security does not segment the
network. Security zones are useful but don’t, by themselves,
segment a network. Often a network is segmented, using
physical partitions or VLAN, to create security zones. A firewall
is meant to block certain traffic, not to segment the network,
although a firewall can be part of a segmentation or security
zone implementation.
■
48. D. Nelson is using a whitelisting (or allowed list) tool. Tools
like this allow only specific applications to be installed and run
on a system and often use hashes of known good applications to
ensure that the applications are those that are permitted. A
blacklisting (or blocked list) tool prevents specific applications
or files from being used, stored, or downloaded to a system.
Although antivirus and antimalware tools may have similar
features, the most accurate answer here is whitelisting.
■
49. B. A stateful inspection firewall examines the content and
context of each packet it encounters. This means that a stateful
packet inspection (SPI) firewall understands the preceding
packets that came from the same IP address, and thus the
context of the communications. This makes certain attacks, like
a SYN flood, almost impossible. Packet filtering firewalls
examine each packet but not the context. Application-layer
firewalls can use SPI or simple packet filtering, but their primary
role is to examine application-specific issues. A common
example is a web application firewall. A gateway firewall is
simply a firewall at the network gateway. This does not tell us
whether it is packet filtering or SPI.
■
50. A. Wireless network heatmaps are used to show how strong
wireless network signals are throughout a building or location.
Scott can use a heatmap like this to see where the wireless signal
drops off or where interference may occur. A network diagram
would show the logical layout of a network. A demilitarized zone
(DMZ) is a network security zone that is exposed to a higher risk
region, and a zone map is not a common security term.
■
51. B. A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a separate subnet coming off
the separate router interface. Public traffic may be allowed to
pass from the external public interface to the DMZ, but it won’t
be allowed to pass to the interface that connects to the internal
private network. A guest network provides visitors with Internet
access. An intranet consists of internal web resources.
Frequently companies put up web pages that are accessible only
from within the network for items like human resources
notifications, vacation requests, and so forth. A virtual LAN, or
VLAN, is used to segment your internal network.
■
52. C. The application includes input validation techniques that are
used to ensure that unexpected or malicious input does not
cause problems with the application. Input validation
techniques will strip out control characters, validate data, and
perform a variety of other actions to clean input before it is
processed by the application or stored for future use. This
validation may help prevent buffer overflows, but other
techniques described here are not used for buffer overflow
prevention. String injection is actually something this helps to
prevent, and schema validation looks at data to ensure that
requests match a schema, but again this is a narrower
description than the broad range of input validation occurring in
the description.
■
53. C. WPA3 supports SAE, or simultaneous authentication of
equals, providing a more secure way to authenticate that limits
the potential for brute-force attacks and allows individuals to
use different passwords. WPA is not as secure as WPA2, and
WEP is the oldest, and least secure, wireless security protocol.
■
54. A. In order to stop attack traffic, an IPS needs to be deployed
inline. Deployments that use a network tap receive a copy of the
data without being in the flow of traffic, which makes them ideal
for detection but removes the ability to stop traffic. Deploying as
an intrusion detection system (IDS) instead of an IPS means
that the system will only detect, not stop, attacks.
■
55. B. The correct answer is to use a sandboxed environment to
test the malware and determine its complete functionality. A
sandboxed system could be an isolated virtual machine (VM) or
an actual physical machine that is entirely isolated from the
network. Leaving the malware on a production system is never
the correct approach. You should test or analyze the malware to
determine exactly what malware it is, allowing you to respond to
the threat properly. A honeypot is used for luring and trapping
attackers, not for testing malware.
■
56. B. Hardening is the process of improving the security of an
operating system or application. One of the primary methods of
hardening a trusted OS is to eliminate unneeded protocols. This
is also known as creating a secure baseline that allows the OS to
run safely and securely. FDE is full-disk encryption, a SED is a
self-encrypting drive, and baselining is the process of
establishing security standards.
■
57. C. Although trust in the site is likely to be reduced because
users will receive warnings, the actual underlying encryption
capabilities will not change. Users will not be redirected to the
certificate authority’s site, and if they click past the warnings,
users will be able to continue normally and with an encrypted
connection.
■
58. D. Isaac knows that trusting client systems to be secure is not a
good idea, and thus ensuring that validation occurs on a trusted
client is not an appropriate recommendation. Ensuring that
validation occurs on a trusted server, that client data is
validated, and that data types and ranges are reasonable are all
good best practices for him to recommend.
■
59. C. Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) provide a random
number generator, the ability to generate cryptographic keys,
support for remote attestation as part of the boot process, as
well as binding and sealing capabilities. They do not act as
cryptographic processors to speed up Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic.
■
60. B. Hashing is commonly used in databases to increase the
speed of indexing and retrieval since it is typically faster to
search for a hashed key rather than the original value stored in a
database. Hashing is not a form of encryption, meaning that it is
not used to encrypt stored data. Hashing is not used to obfuscate
data or to substitute for sensitive data.
■
61. C. The correct answer is to only allow signed components to be
loaded in the browser. Code signing verifies the originator of the
component (such as an ActiveX component) and thus makes
malware far less likely. Although host-based antimalware is a
good idea, it is not the best remedy for this specific threat.
Blacklists cannot cover all sites that are infected—just the sites
you know about. And given that users on Hans’s network visit a
lot of websites, blacklisting is likely to be ineffective. Finally, if
you block all active content, many websites will be completely
unusable.
■
62. B. Zarmeena has implemented a preshared key, or PSK,
authentication method. This means that if she needs to change
the key because a staff member leaves, she will need to have
every device update their passphrase. For larger deployments,
enterprise authentication can connect to an authentication and
authorization service, allowing each user to authenticate as
themselves. This also provides network administrators with a
way to identify individual devices by their authenticated user.
Open networks do not require authentication, although a captive
portal can be used to require network users to provide
information before they are connected to the Internet.
■
63. A. EAP-FAST is specifically designed for organizations that
want to quickly complete reconnections and does not require
certificates to be installed at the endpoint device. EAP Tunneled
Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) requires client-side
certificates; EAP-TLS requires mutual authentication, which can
be slower; and Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol
(PEAP) is similar to EAP-TTLS.
■
64. A. The correct answer is to implement a virtual desktop
infrastructure (VDI). If all the desktops are virtualized, then
from a single central location you can manage patches,
configuration, and software installation. This single
implementation will solve all the issues mentioned in the
question. Restrictive policies are a good idea but are often
difficult to enforce. Imaging workstations will affect only their
original configuration; it won’t keep them patched or prevent
rogue software from being installed. Finally, strong patch
management will address only one of the three concerns.
■
65. B. Deploying to multiple locations is part of a high availability
strategy that ensures that losing a datacenter or datacenters in a
single region, or loss of network connectivity to that region, will
not take an infrastructure down. This does not provide greater
resistance to insider attacks, lower costs, or vendor diversity.
■
66. B. A TLS-based VPN (often called an SSL-based VPN, despite
SSL being outmoded) provides the easiest way for users to use
VPN since it does not require a client. SSL VPNs also work only
for specific applications rather than making a system appear as
though it is fully on a remote network. HTML5 is not a VPN
technology, but some VPN portals may be built using HTML5.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is not a VPN
technology. IPSec VPNs require a client or configuration and are
thus harder for end users to use in most cases.
■
67. C. These particular web application attacks are best mitigated
with proper input validation. Any user input should be checked
for indicators of cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection.
Error handling is always important, but it won’t mitigate these
particular issues. Stored procedures can be a good way of
ensuring SQL commands are standardized, but that won’t
prevent these attacks. Code signing is used for code that is
downloaded from a web application to the client computer; it is
used to protect the client, not the web application.
■
68. C. Isaac can configure a geofence that defines his corporate
buildings and campus. He can then set up a geofence policy that
will only allow devices to work while they are inside that
geofenced area. Patch management, IP filtering, and network
restrictions are not suitable solutions for this.
■
69. B. Fuzzing is a technique whereby the tester intentionally
enters incorrect values into input fields to see how the
application will handle it. Static code analysis tools simply scan
the code for known issues, baselining is the process of
establishing security standards, and version control simply
tracks changes in the code—it does not test the code.
■
70. B. Although hardware security modules (HSMs) provide many
cryptographic functions, they are not used for boot attestation. A
TPM, or Trusted Platform Module, is used for secure boot
attestation.
■
71. A. Cynthia should deploy Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID)
cards, which can be read using contactless readers. RFID
technology is common and relatively inexpensive, but without
additional authentication, possession of a card is the only means
of determining if someone is authorized to access a building or
room. Wi-Fi is not used for contactless cards because of its
power consumption and overhead. Magstripes require a reader
rather than being contactless, and HOTP is a form of one-time
password system.
■
72. B. Rate limiting and back-off algorithms both limit how quickly
queries can be performed. Requiring authentication would
restrict who could access the directory. Requiring LDAPS
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over SSL) does not
prevent enumeration, but it does provide security for the
queried information as it transits networks.
■
73. D. A SAN, or Subject Alternate Name, certificate allows
multiple hostnames to be protected by the same certificate. It is
not a type of certificate for SAN storage systems. A SAN
certificate could be self-signed, but that does not make it a SAN
certificate, and of course the security organization SANS is not a
certificate authority.
■
74. A. The correct answer is to assign digital certificates to the
authorized users and to use these to authenticate them when
logging in. This is an effective way to ensure that only authorized
users can access the application. Although the remaining
options are all good security measures, they are not the best way
to authenticate the client and prevent unauthorized access to the
application.
■
75. D. The correct answer is to first test patches. It is always
possible that a patch might cause issues for one or more current
applications. This is particularly a concern with applications that
have a lot of interaction with the host operating system. An
operating system patch can prevent the application from
executing properly. But as soon as the patches are tested, a
phased rollout to the company should begin. Automatic
patching is not recommended in corporate environments
because a patch could possibly interfere with one or more
applications—thus, a managed patch deployment process is
implemented that requires more administrative time but avoids
outages due to patches with issues in an organization’s specific
environment. Having individual users patch their own machines
is a bad idea and will lead to inconsistent patching and the
application of untested patches. Delegating patch management
to managers instead of IT staff can lead to problems, too, due to
varying skillsets and practices.
■
76. B. Although wireless analyzers provide in-depth information
about Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs), signal strength, and
protocol versions, the Remote Authentication Dial-In User
Service (RADIUS) or Kerberos version number for the backend
authentication servers is not something that they will typically
be able to provide.
■
77. B. The correct answer is to turn off any remote access to such
devices that is not absolutely needed. Many peripheral devices
come with SSH (Secure Shell), Telnet, or similar services. If you
are not using them, turn them off. Many peripherals don’t have
disks to encrypt, making full-disk encryption (FDE) a less useful
choice. Fuzz testing is used to test code, not devices, and
peripherals are unlikely to support digital certificates in most
cases.
■
78. C. Manual code review is a type of static code review where
reviewers read through source code to attempt to find flaws in
the code. Dynamic code review requires running the code, Fagan
testing is a formal code review process that works through
multiple phases of the development process, and fuzzing is a
form of dynamic inspection that sends unexpected values to a
running program.
■
79. C. Samantha should place her public SSH key in the .ssh
directory in her home directory on the remote server. Private
keys should never be outside of your control, and unlike many
Linux configurations, SSH keys are not kept in the /etc/
directory.
■
80. C. The correct answer is to use static code analysis. Memory
leaks are usually caused by failure to deallocate memory that has
been allocated. A static code analyzer can check to see if all
memory allocation commands ( malloc , alloc , etc.) have a
matching deallocation command. Fuzzing involves entering data
that is outside expected values to see how the application
handles it. Stress testing involves testing how a system handles
extreme workloads. Normalization is a technique for
deduplicating a database.
■
81. D. Load balancers provide a virtual IP, or VIP. Traffic sent to
the VIP is directed to servers in the pool based on the loadbalancing
scheme that that pool is using—often a round-robin
scheme, but other versions that include priority order and
capacity tracking or ratings are also common. The load
balancer’s IP address is normally used to administer the system,
and individual IP addresses for the clustered hosts are shielded
by the load balancer to prevent traffic from consistently going to
those hosts, thus creating a failure or load point.
■
82. D. In a well-implemented password hashing scheme, unique
random bits called salts are added to each password before they
are hashed. This makes generating a rainbow table or otherwise
brute-forcing hashes for all of the passwords stored in a
database extremely time-consuming. The remaining options
were made up and are not actual security terms.
■
83. A. The correct answer is to use Secure Shell (SSH). This
protocol is encrypted. SSH also authenticates the user with
public key cryptography. Telnet is insecure and does not encrypt
data. RSH, or Remote Shell, sends at least some data
unencrypted and is also insecure. SNMP, or Simple Network
Management Protocol, is used to manage a network and is not
used for remote communications.
■
84. A. Resource-based policies are attached to resources and
determine who has access to a resource, such as a group of
sysadmins or developers, and what actions they can perform on
the resource. Cloud services have different terms for monitoring
their resource usage; these terms may vary from service to
service.
■
85. A. Networked sensor appliances are deployed in many
datacenters to gather information about temperature and
humidity as part of the environmental monitoring system. Fire
detection and suppression systems are not typically mounted in
racks, and power quality and reliability is measured by PDUs
(power distribution units), UPS (uninterruptable power
supplies), and other power infrastructure.
■
86. C. Secure IMAP’s default port is TCP 993. Laurel can easily
guess that the system offers a TLS-protected version of IMAP for
clients to use to retrieve email messages. The default port for
secure POP is 995, and for secure SMTP the default port is 587.
S/MIME does not have a specific port, as it is used to encrypt
the content of email messages.
■
87. C. Ad hoc wireless networks operate in a point-to-point
topology. Infrastructure mode access points work in a point-tomultipoint
topology. Star and bus models are used in wired
networks.
■
88. C. Only using code that is digitally signed verifies the creator of
the software. For example, if a printer/multifunction device
(MFD) driver is digitally signed, this gives you confidence that it
really is a printer driver from the vendor it purports to be from,
and not malware masquerading as a printer driver. Signed
software gives you a high degree of confidence that it is not
malware but does not provide a guarantee. For example, the
infamous Flame virus was signed with a compromised Microsoft
digital certificate. Digital signing of software has no effect on
patch management. Finally, digitally signed software will not
execute faster or slower than unsigned software.
■
89. D. The Security+ exam refers to password managers as
password vaults. Samantha should recommend a password vault
that will allow her users to generate, store, and use many
passwords securely. None of the other options are good advice
for password use and storage.
■
90. A. Port security filters by MAC address, allowing whitelisted
MAC addresses to connect to the port and blocking blacklisted
MAC addresses. Port security can be static, using a
predetermined list or dynamically allowing a specific number of
addresses to connect, or it can be run in a combination mode of
both static and dynamic modes.
■
91. C. Authentication headers (AHs) provide complete packet
integrity, authenticating the packet and the header.
Authentication headers do not provide any encryption at all, and
authentication headers authenticate the entire packet, not just
the header.
■
92. B. A split horizon DNS implementation deploys distinct DNS
servers for two or more environments, ensuring that those
environments receive DNS information appropriate to the DNS
view that their clients should receive. Domain Name System
Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a DNS security set of
specifications to help protect DNS data. DMZ DNS and DNS
proxying are not design patterns or common terms used in the
security or networking field.
■
93. A. Network taps copy all traffic to another destination, allowing
traffic visibility without a device inline. They are completely
passive methods of getting network traffic to a central location.
Port mirroring would get all the traffic to the network-based
intrusion prevention system (NIPS) but is not completely
passive. It requires the use of resources on switches to route a
copy of the traffic. Incorrect switch configurations can cause
looping. Configuring loop detection can prevent looped ports.
Putting a network IPS on every segment can be very expensive
and require extensive configuration work. Option D is incorrect.
This is not the assignment. Setting up a NIPS on each segment
would also dramatically increase administrative efforts.
■
94. C. Federating RADIUS allows organizations to permit users
from other partner organizations to authenticate against their
home systems, and then be allowed on to the local organization’s
network. An example of this is the eduroam federation used by
higher education institutions to permit students, faculty, and
staff to use college networks anywhere they go where eduroam is
in place. Preshared keys are determined by the location
organization and would not permit enterprise credentials from
other organizations to be used. OpenID is used for web
authentication, and 802.11q is a trunking protocol.
■
95. C. Context-aware authentication can take into account
information like geolocation to ensure that the devices can only
be logged into when they are inside of the facility’s boundaries.
That means the devices will only be useful on-site and can help
protect the data and applications on the devices. Neither PINs
nor biometrics can do this, and content-aware authentication
was made up for this question.
■
96. B. A TPM, or Trusted Platform Module, is a secure
cryptoprocessor used to provide a hardware root of trust for
systems. They enable secure boot and boot attestation
capabilities, and include a random number generator, the ability
to generate cryptographic keys for specific uses, and the ability
to bind and seal data used for processes the TPM supports.
■
97. B. Internet key exchange (IKE) is used to set up security
associations (SAs) on each end of the tunnel. The security
associations have all the settings (i.e., cryptographic algorithms,
hashes) for the tunnel. IKE is not directly involved in encrypting
or authenticating. IKE itself does not establish the tunnel—it
establishes the SAs.
■
98. A. A root certificate is the base certificate that signs an entire
certificate chain. A common security practice to protect these
incredibly important certificates is to keep the root certificate
and CA offline to prevent the potential of compromise or
exposure. Machine/computer, user, and email certificates are
deployed and used throughout organizations and, since they are
used on a frequent basis, aren’t likely be to kept offline.
■
99. A. The NIPS is not seeing the traffic on that network segment.
By implementing port mirroring, the traffic from that segment
can be copied to the segment where the NIPS is installed.
Installing a network IPS on the segment would require
additional resources. This would work but is not the most
efficient approach. Nothing in this scenario suggests that the
NIPS is inadequate. It just is not seeing all the traffic. Finally,
isolating the segment to its own VLAN would isolate that
network segment but would still not allow the NIPS to analyze
the traffic from that segment.
■
100. B. Tokenization is used to protect data by substituting tokens
for sensitive data without changing the length or data type. This
allows databases to handle the data in the same way as it was
prior to tokenization, ensuring that existing software will not
run into problems due to the data being changed. Encryption
provides similar protection but will normally change either the
data length, the data type, or both. Hashing is one-way, which
means it is not a good fit for many scenarios where tokenization
or encryption will protect data. Rotation is not a security method
used for this type of work.
■
101. A. Elenora could deploy a log aggregator at each location to
collect and aggregate the logs. Log collection and aggregation
systems can then filter unneeded log entries, compress the logs,
and forward desired logs to a central security system like a
security information and event management (SIEM) or other log
analysis collection and analysis tool. A honeypot acts like a
desirable target, luring attackers in to capture data about their
attacks. A bastion host is designed to resist attacks and normally
provides a single service to the network on which it resides.
■
102. D. Fuzzing is an automated, dynamic software testing
technique that sends unexpected and often invalid data to a
program to test how it responds. The software is monitored to
see how it responds to the input, providing additional assurance
that the program has proper error handling and input validation
built in. Timeboxing is an agile project management technique;
buffer overflows may occur as part of fuzzing, but are not the
only technique used or described here; and input validation can
help stop fuzzing from causing problems for an application by
preventing out-of-bounds or unwanted data from being
accepted.
■
103. B. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping can
be set up on switches to monitor for and stop rogue DHCP traffic
from unknown servers. Disabling DHCP snooping would remove
this feature. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) cannot stop
traffic, and blocking DHCP traffic would prevent systems from
acquiring dynamic IP addresses.
■
104. B. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) focuses on
identifying anomalies and issues, but it is not designed to be a
malware analysis tool. Instead, the ability to search and explore
data, identify suspicious activities, and coordinate responses is
what makes up an EDR tool.
■
105. A. A web proxy can be used to block certain websites. It is
common practice for network administrators to block either
individual sites or general classes of sites (like job-hunting
sites). Network address translation (NAT) is used to translate
the private IP addresses of internal computers to public IP
addresses. A packet filter firewall can block traffic on a given
port or IP address or using a particular protocol, but generally
they are not able to block specific websites. Network-based
intrusion prevention systems (NIPSs) identify and block attacks;
they cannot prevent users from visiting specific websites.
■
106. C. Secrets management services provide the ability to store
sensitive data like application programming interface (API)
keys, passwords, and certificates. They also provide the ability to
manage, retrieve, and audit those secrets. A public key
infrastructure (PKI) would focus on certificates and encryption
keys, without passwords or API keys. A Trusted Platform
Module (TPM) is associated with hardware, and a hush service
was made up for this question.
■
107. A. SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language, is used by
many identity providers to exchange authorization and
authentication data with service providers. Kerberos and LDAP
(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) are used inside many
organizations, but Fred will find more success with SAML for
popular web services. New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)
remains in use for Windows systems, but Kerberos is more
commonly used for modern Windows domains and would not be
used in the scenario described here.
■
108. D. Load balancing the cluster will prevent any single server
from being overloaded. And if a given server is offline, other
servers can take on its workload. Option A is incorrect. A VPN
concentrator, as the name suggests, is used to initiate virtual
private networks (VPNs). Option B is incorrect. Aggregate
switching can shunt more bandwidth to the servers but won’t
mitigate the threat of one or more servers being offline. Option
C is incorrect. SSL accelerators are a method of offloading
processor-intensive public-key encryption for Transport Layer
Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to a hardware
accelerator.
■
109. C. The three channels that do not overlap are 1, 6, and 11. The
rest of the channels will overlap. In an ideal installation, these
three channels can be used to maximize throughput and
minimize interference.
■
110. B. The correct answer is to encrypt all the web traffic to this
application using Transport Layer Security (TLS). This is one of
the most fundamental security steps to take with any website. A
web application firewall (WAF) is probably a good idea, but it is
not the most important thing for Ryan to implement. While a
network-based intrusion prevention system (IPS) or intrusion
detection system (IDS) may be a good idea, those should be
considered after TLS is configured.
■
111. B. Infrared (IR) is the only line-of-sight method on the list.
Although Near-Field Communication (NFC) and Bluetooth have
a relatively short range, they can still operate through materials
placed between them and the receiver, and Wi-Fi can do so at an
even longer range.
■
112. A. The correct answer is that Kerberos uses various tickets,
each with a time limit. The service tickets are typically only good
for 5 minutes or less. This means that if the Network Time
Protocol (NTP) is failing, valid tickets may appear to be expired.
RADIUS, CHAP, and LDAP will not have any significant effect
due to NTP failure.
■
113. C. The correct answer is that Challenge Handshake
Authentication Protocol (CHAP) periodically has the client
reauthenticate. This is transparent to the user but is done
specifically to prevent session hijacking. Password
Authentication Protocol (PAP) is actually quite old and does not
reauthenticate. In fact, it even sends the password in cleartext,
so it should not be used any longer. SPAP (Shiva Password
Authentication Protocol) adds password encryption to PAP but
does not reauthenticate. OAuth is used in web authentication
and does not reauthenticate.
■
114. B. A software firewall is best suited to deployments to
individual machines, particularly when endpoint systems are
being protected. Hardware firewalls are typically deployed to
protect network segments or groups of systems, and result in
additional expense and management. Virtual and cloud firewalls
are most often deployed in datacenters where virtual or cloud
environments are in use, although a virtual firewall could be run
on an endpoint.
■
115. D. A service account is the most appropriate in this scenario.
Service accounts are given the least privileges the service needs
and are used by the service, without the need for a human user.
Although you could assign a user account, it is not as good a
solution as using a service account. A guest account would never
be a good idea for a service. Guest accounts are typically too
limited. It’s common practice to disable default accounts such as
the Guest account. An admin account would give too many
privileges to the service and violate the principle of least
privileges.
■
116. A. Of these versions of Extensible Authentication Protocol
(EAP), only Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol
(LEAP) does not support TLS. EAP Tunneled Transport Layer
Security (EAP-TTLS) actually extends TLS, but supports the
underlying protocol. Protected Extensible Authentication
Protocol (PEAP) encapsulates EAP within an encrypted TLS
tunnel.
■
117. C. Jailbreaking allows users to add software to an iPhone that
isn’t normally allowed, including third-party applications,
changing system settings, themes, or default applications. Thirdparty
application stores aren’t available by default, and sideloading
can be accomplished in iOS but doesn’t do what Manny
wants it to, and of course installing Android won’t let Manny
change iOS settings. If Manny does jailbreak his phone, his
organization may notice if they’re using a mobile device
management (MDM) or unified endpoint management (UEM)
application to track the status of the device.
■
118. C. Many smartcards implement Radio Frequency Identification
(RFID) to allow them to be used for entry access and other
purposes. Wi-Fi, Infrared, and Bluetooth generally require
powered circuits to interact with systems, making them a poor
fit for a smartcard that does not typically have a battery or other
power source.
■
119. A. Mandatory access control (MAC) is the correct solution. It
will not allow lower privileged users to even see the data at a
higher privilege level. Discretionary access control (DAC) has
each data owner configure his or her own security. Role-based
access control (RBAC) could be configured to meet the needs,
but it’s not the best solution for these requirements. Security
Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is not an access control
model.
■
120. B. An agent-based, preadmission system will provide greater
insight into the configuration of the system using the agent, and
using a preadmission model will allow the system configuration
to be tested before the system is allowed to connect to the
network. Agentless NAC uses scanning and/or network
inventory techniques and will typically not have as deep a level
of insight into the configuration and software versions running
on a system. Postadmission systems make enforcement
decisions based on what users do after they gain admission to a
network, rather than prior to gaining admission, allowing you to
quickly rule out two of these options.
■
121. C. Claire’s best option is to deploy a detection and fix via her
web application firewall (WAF) that will detect the SQL injection
attempt and prevent it. An intrusion detection system (IDS) only
detects attacks and cannot stop them. Manually updating the
application code after reverse-engineering it will take time, and
she may not even have the source code or the ability to modify it.
Finally, vendor patches for zero days typically take some time to
come out even in the best of circumstances, meaning that Claire
could be waiting on a patch for quite a while if that is the option
she chooses.
■
122. C. CYOD, or choose your own device, allows users to choose a
device that is corporate owned and paid for. Choices may be
limited to set of devices, or users may be allowed to choose
essentially any device depending on the organization’s
deployment decisions. BYOD allows users to bring their own
device, whereas COPE, or corporate-owned, personally enabled,
provides devices to users that they can then use for personal use.
VDI uses a virtual desktop infrastructure as an access layer for
any security model where specialized needs or security
requirements may require access to remote desktop or
application services.
■
123. B. The key element here is that the certificate authorities (CA)
are operating in a mesh, meaning no CA is the root CA and that
each must trust the others. To accomplish this, Derek first needs
to issue certificates from D to each of the other Cas and then
have the others issue D a certificate. Private keys should never
be exchanged, and of course if he only has the other systems
issue D certificates, they won’t recognize his server.
■
124. C. If Claire is using Simple Network Management Protocol
(SNMP) to manage and monitor her network devices, she should
make sure she is using SNMPv3 and that it is properly
configured. SNMPv3 can provide information about the status
and configuration of her network devices. Remote
Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) might be used to
authenticate to the network, but Transport Layer Security (TLS)
and SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) are not specifically used
for the purposes described.
■
125. D. Fuzzers send unexpected and out of range data to
applications to see how they will respond. In this case, Ben is
using a fuzzer. Web proxies are often used to do application
testing because they allow data to be changed between the
browser and the application. SQL injection may be done via a
web proxy, but a dedicated SQL injection proxy is not a type of
tool by itself. Finally, a static code review tool is used to review
source code and may be as simple as a Notepad application or as
complex as a fully integrated development environment (IDE).
■
126. B. Containerization will allow Eric’s company’s tools and data
to be run inside of an application-based container, isolating the
data and programs from the self-controlled bring your own
device (BYOD) devices. Storage segmentation can be helpful, but
the operating system itself as well as the applications would
remain a concern. Eric should recommend full-device
encryption (FDE) as a security best practice, but encrypting the
container and the data it contains can provide a reasonable
security layer even if the device itself is not fully encrypted.
Remote wipe is helpful if devices are lost or stolen, but the end
user may not be okay with having the entire device wiped, and
there are ways to work around remote wipes, including blocking
cellular and Wi-Fi signals.
■
127. B. Kerberos does not send the users password across the
network. When the user’s name is sent to the authentication
service, the service retrieves the hash of the user’s password
from the database, and then uses that as a key to encrypt data to
be sent back to the user. The user’s machine takes the password
that the user entered, hashes it, and then uses that as a key to
decrypt what was sent back by the server. Challenge Handshake
Authentication Protocol (CHAP) sends the user’s password in an
encrypted form. RBAC is an access control model, not an
authentication protocol. Type II authentication is something you
have, such as a key or card.
■
128. A. EV, or extended validation, certificates prove that the X.509
certificate has been issued to the correct legal entity. In addition,
only specific certificate authorities (Cas) can issue EV
certificates. Domain-validated certificates require proof that you
have control of the domain, such as setting the DNS TXT record
or responding to an email sent to a contact in the domain’s
Whois record. An organizational validation certificate requires
either domain validation and additional proof that the
organization is a legal entity. OCSP certificates were made up for
this question.
■
129. D. Wi-Fi 5 networks can provide theoretical throughput up to
3.5 Gbps megabits per second, although newer standards like
Wi-Fi 6 continue to push this higher. The next fastest wireless
standard listed is LTE cellular with theoretical throughputs
around 50 megabits per second. When bandwidth is important,
Wi-Fi will tend to win, although 5G cellular networks under
ideal conditions may rival Wi-Fi.
■
130. C. The cost of applications and the quality of the security
implementation can vary based on the vendor and product, but
cloud-native security solutions will generally have better and
deeper integration into the cloud platform than third-party
solutions will. Vendor diversity in designs may still drive other
choices, but those are conscious design decisions.
■
131. D. Jump boxes are a common solution for providing access to a
network with a different security profile. In this case, Ed can
deploy a jump box in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) to allow
users within his administrative zone to perform tasks without
directly connecting to the world-exposed DMZ. This helps keep
administrative systems secure and allows him to focus on the
security of the jump box, while also making it easier to monitor
and maintain. An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is used to
monitor and block unwanted traffic, but isn’t used for remote
access. A NAT gateway performs network address translation
and is placed between networks but is not typically used to
provide secure connections between networks. Instead, it serves
to reduce the number of public IP addresses used and to provide
some limited security for systems behind it. Routers are used to
connect to networks but are not used to provide secure access as
described in the question.
■
132. C. OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for tokenbased
authentication and authorization on the Internet and
allows an end user’s account information to be used by thirdparty
services, without exposing the user’s password. Kerberos is
a network authentication protocol and not used for crossdomain/
service authentication. Security Assertion Markup
Language (SAML) is an XML-based, open-standard data format
for exchanging authentication and authorization data between
parties. OpenID is an authentication service often provided by a
third party, and it can be used to sign into any website that
accepts OpenID. It would be possible for this to work, but only
with websites that support OpenID, so it is not as good a
solution as OAuth.
■
133. A. Session persistence makes sure that all of a client’s traffic for
a transaction or session goes to the same server or service. The
remaining options do not properly describe how session
persistence works.
■
134. B. Data loss prevention (DLP) tools allow sensitive data to be
tagged and monitored so that if a user attempts to send it, they
will be notified, administrators will be informed, and if
necessary, the data can be protected using encryption or other
protection methods before it is sent. Full-disk encryption (FDE)
would protect data at rest, and S/MIME and POP3S would
protect mail being retrieved from a server but would not prevent
the SSNs from being sent.
■
135. B. While infrastructure as a service (IaaS) vendors often
provide strong support for high availability, including
replication to multiple geographic zones or regions, as well as
highly reliable and secure storage, they do not allow direct
access to the underlying hardware in most instances. If Jennifer
requires direct access to hardware, she will need to deploy to a
datacenter where she can retain access to the physical servers.
■
136. B. Out-of-band (OOB) management uses separate management
interfaces, as shown in the figure, or a different connectivity
method than the normal connection to provide a secure means
of managing systems. A DMZ, or demilitarized zone, is a security
zone that is typically exposed to the world and is thus less
trusted and more exposed. In-band management uses common
protocols like Secure Shell (SSH) or HTTPS to manage devices
via their normal interfaces or network connections. Transport
Layer Security (TLS) is a security protocol, not a management
interface.
■
137. A. Key escrow provides encryption keys to a third party so that
they can be released to an appropriate party if certain conditions
are met. Although this means that the keys are out of the control
of the owning or responsible party, in many cases the need to
have a recoverable or accessible way to get to the keys overrides
the requirement to keep the keys in a single individual or
organization’s hands. The remaining options were made up, but
you may encounter the term “key recovery,” which is a process
where law enforcement or other parties may recover keys when
needed using a process that provides them with an access key or
decryption key that may not be the same key as the key used by
the original encryption user.
■
138. D. Boot attestation requires systems to track and measure the
boot process and to then attest to a system that the process was
secure. Secure boot, which is a related concept, allows only
trusted software to be run using previously hashed values to
ensure the process is secure. BOOTP and BIOS are not involved
in this process, instead, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
(UEFI) firmware supports both secure boot and boot attestation.
■
139. A. The correct answer is that OpenID is an authentication
service often done by a third party, and it can be used to sign
into any website that accepts OpenID. Kerberos is a network
authentication protocol for use within a domain. New
Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is an older Windows
authentication protocol. Shibboleth is a single sign-on system,
but it works with federated systems.
■
140. C. Disabling remote registry access for systems that do not
require it can prevent remote registry modification and reads.
This is a recommended best practice whenever possible, but
some systems may require remote registry access for
management or other reasons. The Windows registry is not
independently patched, the registry needs to be readable and
writable to have a functional Windows system, and there is no
mode that encrypts user keys.
■
141. D. Maximizing coverage overlap would cause greater
contention between access points. Instead, installations should
minimize overlap without leaving dead spots in important areas.
Performing a site survey, controlling power levels and adjusting
them to minimize contention, and designing around the
construction materials of a building are all important parts of
designing the physical layout and placement of WAPs.
Fortunately, modern enterprise wireless networks have
advanced intelligent features that help do many of these things
somewhat automatically.
■
142. B. Disabling the account is the best option to meet Mark’s
needs. Disabling an account will leave it in a different state than
an active account or one with a changed password, which should
be noted by support staff if Gabby called and asked to change
her password. That means that there is less risk of a disgruntled
employee or an attacker successfully gaining access to the
account. At the same time, disabling is less destructive than
deleting the account, making it faster to restore and preserving
her files and other materials. Most organizations will choose to
have a time limit for how long an account can be in a disabled
state without review or moving to another account state to help
ensure that disabled accounts do not build up over time.
■
143. A. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) looks at a group of
attributes, in addition to the login username and password, to
make decisions about whether or not to grant access. One of the
attributes examined is the location of the person. Since the users
in this company travel frequently, they will often be at new
locations, and that might cause ABAC to reject their logins.
Wrong passwords can certainly prevent login, but are not
specific to ABAC. ABAC does not prevent remote access, and a
firewall can be configured to allow, or prohibit, any traffic you
wish.
■
144. B. Single Sign-On (SSO) is designed specifically to address this
risk and would be the most helpful. Users have only a single
logon to remember; thus, they have no need to write down the
password. OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for
token-based authentication and authorization on the Internet. It
does not eliminate the use or need for multiple passwords.
Multifactor authentication helps prevent risks due to lost
passwords, but does not remove the need for multiple passwords
by itself. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) do not stop users
from needing to remember multiple passwords.
■
145. D. Rule-based access control applies a set of rules to an access
request. Based on the application of the rules, the user may be
given access to a specific resource that they were not explicitly
granted permission to. MAC, DAC, and role-based access control
wouldn’t give a user access unless that user has already been
explicitly given that access.
■
146. B. Segmentation needs between multiple cloud virtual
datacenters, the cost of operating the firewall service, and the
visibility into traffic provided by the cloud service provider are
all design elements Ed will need to consider. He won’t, however,
need to worry about hardware access for updates. Instead, he is
likely to either use a virtual cloud appliance or built-in firewall
functionality provided by the cloud infrastructure service
provider.
■
147. B. Tokens are physical devices that often contain cryptographic
data for authentication. They can store digital certificates for use
with authentication. OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open
standard for token-based authentication and authorization on
the Internet. The user still must remember a password. OpenID
is a third-party authentication service, and just as with OAuth,
the user also still must remember a password. Role-based access
control and rule-based access control (which both use the
acronym RBAC) are access control models.
■
148. A. Internal services like this are part of an intranet, a network,
or website only accessible to individuals and systems inside of a
company. Extranets are private networks that allow access to
partners or customers, but not to the general public. A
demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a network segment exposed to the
Internet or another untrusted network. A TTL is a network term
that means time to live, and it determines how many hops a
packet can make before it is no longer able to be sent to another
hop.
■
149. B. This question describes a stateless firewall, which looks at
every packet to make decisions about what will be allowed
through it. Stateful firewalls pay attention the conversations and
allow packets in a conversation between devices to pass through
once it has verified the initial exchange. Next-generation
firewalls (NGFWs) build in a wide variety of security services.
Application-layer firewalls understand applications that run
through them and provide deeper packet analysis capabilities to
block unwanted application layer traffic.
■
150. C. Hardware security modules are available as smartcards,
microSD cards, and USB thumb drives in addition to their
frequent deployment as appliances in enterprise use. Nancy
could purchase a certified and tested MicroSD card–based HSM
that would protect her keys in a secure way. An applicationbased
public key infrastructure (PKI) would not provide the
same level of security on most mobile devices without specially
designed hardware, which is not mentioned in this problem.
OPAL is a hardware-based encryption standard and does not
provide key management, and an offline certificate authority
(CA) would not help in this circumstance.
■
151. D. Both the Windows and Linux filesystems work based on a
discretionary access control scheme where file and directory
owners can determine who can access, change, or otherwise
work with files under their control. Role-based access controls
systems determine rights based on roles that are assigned to
users. Rule-based access control systems use a series of rules to
determine which actions can occur, and mandatory access
control systems enforce control at the operating system level.
■
152. A. Restricting each faculty account so that it is only usable
when that particular faculty member is typically on campus will
prevent someone from logging in with that account after hours,
even if they have the password. Usage auditing may detect
misuse of accounts but will not prevent it. Longer passwords are
effective security, but a longer password can still be stolen.
Credential management is always a good idea, but it won’t
address this specific issue.
■
153. D. Although next-generation firewalls provide may defensive
capabilities, SQL injection is an attack instead of a defense. In
addition to geolocation, intrusion detection system (IDS) and
intrusion prevention system (IPS), and sandboxing capabilities,
many next-generation firewalls include web application
firewalls, load balancing, IP reputation and URL filtering, and
antimalware and antivirus features.
■
154. C. Enabling storm control on a switch will limit the amount of
total bandwidth that broadcast packets can use, preventing
broadcast storms from taking down the network. Blocking
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) would prevent systems from
finding each other, and blocking all broadcast packets would
also block many important network features.
■
155. B. Demilitarized zones (DMZs) remain a useful concept when
designing cloud environments, although the technical
implementation may vary, since cloud providers may have
secure web services, load-balancing capabilities or other features
that make DMZs look different. Proxy servers are useful for
controlling, filtering, and relaying traffic, but they do not
provide the full segmentation that Isaac is looking for. A VPC is
a virtual datacenter and will typically contain his infrastructure
but does not specifically address these needs.
■
156. A. A permissions audit will find what permissions each user has
and compare that to their job requirements. Permission audits
should be conducted periodically. Job rotation, though
beneficial for other security reasons, will actually exacerbate this
problem. It is impractical to forbid anyone from ever changing
job roles, and separation of duties would have no impact on this
issue.
■
157. B. Susan’s best option is to deploy full-disk encryption (FDE),
which will ensure that the entire drive is encrypted, rather than
just specific folders or files. Degaussing magnetic drives will
wipe them, rather than protecting data.
■
158. C. Password complexity requires that passwords have a
mixture of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and
special characters. This would be the best approach to correct
the problem described in the question. Longer passwords are a
good security measure but will not correct the issue presented
here. Changing passwords won’t make those passwords any
stronger, and Single Sign-On (SSO) will have no effect on the
strength of passwords.
■
159. D. WPA3’s Personal mode replaces the preshared key mode
found in WPA2 with simultaneous authentication of equals. This
makes weak passphrase or password attacks harder to conduct
and allows for greater security when devices are conducting
their initial key exchange. WEP, WPA, and WPA2 do not
implement SAE.
■
160. C. Megan has created a guest account. Guest accounts typically
have very limited privileges and may be set up with limited login
hours, an expiration date, or other controls to help keep them
more secure. User accounts are the most common type of
account and are issued to individuals to allow them to log into
and use systems and services. Shared accounts are used by more
than one person, making it difficult to determine who used the
account. A service account is typically associated with a program
or service running on a system that requires rights to files or
other resources.
■
161. B. API keys allow individual customers to authenticate to the
API service, which means that if there is a problem Henry can
disable the problematic API keys rather than all users. Enabling
logging using a service like Amazon’s API Gateway allows
scalability, logging, and monitoring, as well as tools like web
application firewalls. An API proxy and API-centric intrusion
prevention system (IPS) were made up for this question.
■
162. C. UTM, or unified threat management, devices commonly
serve as firewalls, intrusion detection system (IDS)/intrusion
prevention system (IPS), antivirus, web proxies, web application
and deep packet inspection, secure email gateways, data loss
prevention (DLP), security information and event management
(SIEM), and even virtual private networking (VPN) devices.
They aren’t mobile device management (MDM) or universal
endpoint management devices, however, since their primary
focus is on network security, not systems or device management.
■
163. B. Mandatory access control (MAC) is based on documented
security levels associated with the information being accessed.
Role-based access control (RBAC) is based on the role the user is
placed in. Discretionary access control (DAC) lets the data
owner set access control. BAC is not an access control model.
■
164. A. This image shows a forward proxy, which can be used to
apply policies to user requests sent to web servers and other
services. Reverse proxies act as gateways between users and
application servers, allowing content caching and traffic
manipulation. They are often used by content delivery networks
to help with traffic management.
■
165. B. This type of potential security issue is typically recorded as
an impossible travel time/risky login issue. Gurvinder would not
expect the user to have traveled between two locations in an
hour—in fact, it is impossible to do so. That means he needs to
contact the user to find out if they may have done something like
use a VPN, or if their account may be compromised. It is
possible this could be an issue with the geo-IP system that
Gurvinder’s company uses, but he needs to treat it like a security
risk until he determines otherwise, and a compromise is more
likely in most cases. A misconfigured IP address would not cause
this issue.
■
166. A. Discretionary access control (DAC) allows data owners to
assign permissions. Role-based access control (RBAC) assigns
access based on the role the user is in. Mandatory access control
(MAC) is stricter and enforces control at the OS level. Attributecased
access control (ABAC) considers various attributes such as
location, time, and computer in addition to username and
password.
■
167. A. OS hardening is the process of securing an operating system
by patching, updating, and configuring the operating system to
be secure. Configuration management is the ongoing process of
managing configurations for systems, rather than this initial
security step. Both security uplift and endpoint lockdown were
made up for this question.
■
168. D. Secure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAPS) uses
port 636 by default. DNS uses port 53, LDAP uses 389, and
secure HTTP uses port 443.
■
169. C. The best answer for the needs Chris has identified is a
hardware security module, or HSM. HSMs can act as a
cryptographic key manager, including creating, storing, and
securely handling encryption keys and certificates. They can also
act as cryptographic accelerators, helping offload encryption
functions like Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. A
TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is a device used to store keys
for a system but does not offload cryptoprocessing, and it is used
for keys on a specific system rather than broader uses. CPUs and
GPUs may have cryptographic acceleration functions, but they
do not securely store or manage certificates and other
encryption artifacts.
■
170. D. A host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS) can
monitor network traffic to identify attacks, suspicious behavior,
and known bad patterns using signatures. A firewall stops traffic
based on rules; antimalware tools are specifically designed to
stop malware, not attacks and suspicious network behavior; and
a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) can only detect,
not stop, these behaviors.
■
171. B. Role-based access control (RBAC) grants permissions based
on the user’s position within the organization. Mandatory access
control (MAC) uses security classifications to grant permissions.
Discretionary access control (DAC) allows data owners to set
permissions. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) considers
various attributes such as location, time, and computer, in
addition to username and password.
■
172. B. Measured boot provides a form of boot attestation that
records information about each component loaded during the
boot process. This information can then be reported to a server
for validation. Trusted boot validates each component against a
known signature. Measured boot does not care about the time to
boot up, nor does it update the system’s Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI).
■
173. D. The key distribution center (KDC) issues tickets. The tickets
are generated by the ticket-granting service, which is usually
part of the KDC. The authentication service simply authenticates
the user, X.509 certificates and certificate authorities are not
part of Kerberos, and the ticket-granting service does generate
the ticket but the KDC issues it.
■
174. C. Although patching devices is important, the most effective
way to protect devices from being attacked via administrative
account brute forcing is to place the devices on a separate
management virtual LAN (VLAN) and then control access to
that VLAN. This will prevent most attackers from being able to
connect to the device’s administrative interfaces. Disabling
administrative access may not be possible, and even if it was, it
would create significant problems when the devices needed to
have changes made on them.
■
175. A. While mobile device management (MDM) and unified
endpoint management (UEM) tools provide many capabilities,
carrier unlock status normally needs to be checked with the
carrier if you want to validate corporate-owned phones without
manually checking each device.
■
176. A. Zero-trust environments typically have a more complex
network due to increased segmentation to isolate systems and
devices that have different security contexts. Zero-trust
networks also require strong identity and access management,
and they use application-aware firewalls extensively to preserve
least privilege. Of course, logging and analysis of security events
is necessary to ensure that issues are identified and responded
to.
■
177. A. Digital certificates use the X.509 standard (or the PGP
standard) and allow the user to digitally sign authentication
requests. OAuth allows an end user’s account information to be
used by third-party services, without exposing the user’s
password. It does not use digital certificates or support digital
signing. Kerberos does not use digital certificates, nor does it
support digitally signing. Smartcards can contain digital
certificates but don’t necessarily have to have them.
■
178. C. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an
Extensible Markup Language (XML) framework for creating and
exchanging security information between partners online. The
integrity of users is the weakness in the SAML identity chain. To
mitigate this risk, SAML systems need to use timed sessions,
HTTPS, and SSL/TLS. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol) is a protocol that enables a user to locate individuals
and other resources such as files and devices in a network.
Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus
(TACACS+) is a protocol that is used to control access into
networks. TACACS+ provides authentication and authorization
in addition to an accounting of access requests against a central
database. Transitive trust is a two-way relationship that is
automatically created between a parent and a child domain in a
Microsoft Active Directory (AD) forest. It shares resources with
its parent domain by default and enables an authenticated user
to access resources in both the child and parent domains.
■
179. C. UEM, or unified endpoint management, manages desktop,
laptops, mobile devices, printers, and other types of devices.
Mobile device management (MDM) tools focus on mobile
devices.
■
180. B. Host-based firewalls are the first step in most designs when
protecting against network-borne threats. They can prevent
unwanted traffic from entering or leaving the host, leaving less
traffic for a host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS) or
other tools to analyze. Full-disk encryption (FDE) will not stop
network-borne threats, and antivirus focuses on prevention of
malware, not network threats like denial of service or
exploitation of vulnerable services.
■
181. A. Security groups are a virtual firewall for instances, allowing
rules to be applied to traffic between instances. Dynamic
resource allocation is a concept that allows resources to be
applied as they are needed, including scaling up and down
infrastructure and systems on the fly. Virtual private cloud
(VPC) endpoints are a way to connect to services inside of a
cloud provider without an Internet gateway. Finally, instance
awareness is a concept that means that tools know about the
differences between instances, rather than treating each
instance in a scaling group as the same. This can be important
during incident response processes and security monitoring for
scaled groups, where resources may all appear identical without
instance awareness.
■
182. D. Although built-in update tools will handle the operating
system, additional software installed on systems needs to be
patched separately. Third-party software and firmware,
including the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or
BIOS of the systems that are deployed in Derek’s organization,
will need regular updates. Many organizations adopt patch
management platforms or system management platforms with
patching capabilities to ensure that this occurs on a broader
basis than just OS patches.
■
183. A. IDSs, or intrusion detection systems, can only detect
unwanted and malicious traffic based on the detection rules and
signatures that they have. They cannot stop traffic or modify it.
An IPS, or intrusion prevention system, that is placed inline with
network traffic can take action on that traffic. Thus, IDSs are
often used when it is not acceptable to block network traffic, or
when a tap or other network device is used to clone traffic for
inspection.
■
184. C. Although insider threats are a concern, they’re not any
different for containers than any other system. Ensuring
container host security, securing the management stack, and
making sure that network traffic to and from containers is
secure are all common container security concerns.
■
185. C. Network address translation (NAT) gateways allow internal
IP addresses to be hidden from the outside, preventing direct
connections to systems behind them. This effectively firewalls
inbound traffic unless the gateway is set to pass traffic to an
internal host when a specific IP, port, and protocol is used. They
are not a firewall in the traditional sense, however, and do not
specifically statefully block traffic by port and protocol, nor do
they detect malicious traffic. Finally, NAT gateways are not used
to send non-IP traffic out to IP networks.
■
186. C. Conditional access assesses specific conditions to make a
determination about whether to allow an account to access a
resource. The system may choose to allow access, to block
access, or to apply additional controls based on the conditions
that are present and the information that is available about the
login.
■
187. B. If the system maintains a password history, that would
prevent any user from reusing an old password. Password
complexity and length are common security settings but would
not prevent the behavior described. Multifactor authentication
helps prevent brute-force attacks and reduces the potential
impact of stolen passwords but would not help with this
scenario.
■
188. D. Bridge Protocol Data Unit, or BDPU, guard protects network
infrastructure by preventing unknown devices from
participating in spanning tree. That prevents a new switch
added by a user from claiming to be the root bridge (in this case,
Switch C), which would normally cause a topology change and
for traffic to be sent to Switch X, an undesirable result. 802.11n
is a wireless protocol, and the remaining options were made up
for this question.
■
189. A. The net user command allows this control to be put in place.
Although you may not be familiar with the many net user
commands, you can take out unrealistic commands or
commands with flaws in them. For example, here you could
likely guess that -working-hours isn’t a defined term. In the same
way, login isn’t a Windows command, but net commands are
commonly used to control Windows systems.
■
190. A. Auditing and reviewing how users actually utilize their
account permissions would be the best way to determine if there
is any inappropriate use. A classic example would be a bank loan
officer. By the nature of their job, they have access to loan
documents. But they should not be accessing loan documents for
loans they are not servicing. The issue in this case is not
permissions, because the users require permission to access the
data. The issue is how the users are using their permissions.
Usage auditing and permissions auditing are both part of
account maintenance, but auditing and review is a better
answer. Finally, this is not a policy issue.
■
191. B. A scenario such as guest Wi-Fi access does not provide the
logins with any access to corporate resources. The people
logging in merely get to access the Internet. This poses very
limited security risk to the corporate network and thus is often
done with a common or shared account. Tech support personnel
generally have significant access to corporate network resources.
Although this is a relatively low access scenario, it is still
important to know which specific student is logging on and
accessing what resources. Any level of access to corporate
resources should have its own individual login account.
■
192. B. Certificate chains list certificates and certificate authority
(CA) certificates, allowing those who receive the certificate to
validate that the certificates can be trusted. An invalid, or
broken, chain means that the user or system that is checking the
certificate chaining should not trust the system and certificate.
■
193. D. 802.1X is the IEEE standard for port-based network access
control. This protocol is frequently used to authenticate devices.
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is an
authentication protocol but not the best choice for device
authentication. Kerberos is an authentication protocol but not
the best choice for device authentication. 802.11i is the Wi-Fi
security standard and is fully implemented in WPA2 and WPA3.
It is not a device authentication procedure.
■
194. A. WPA2 uses the AES-based CCMP, or Counter Mode Block
Chaining Message Authentication (CBC-MAC) Protocol to
encapsulate traffic, providing confidentiality. WPA3 also uses
CCMP as the minimum acceptable encryption in WPA3-
Personal mode. WEP, infrared, and Bluetooth do not use CCMP.
■
195. A. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) would give
an attacker a great deal of information about your network.
SNMP should not be exposed to unprotected networks, SNMPv3
should be implemented, and SNMP security best practices
should be followed. Both POP3 and IMAP are email access
protocols, and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is
used to hand out dynamic IP addresses.
■
196. C. Accounts should lock out after a small number of login
attempts. Three is a common number of attempts before the
account is locked out. This prevents someone from just
attempting random guesses. Password aging will force users to
change their passwords but won’t affect password guessing.
Longer passwords would be harder to guess, but this option is
not as effective as account lockout policies. Account usage
auditing won’t have any effect on this issue.
■
197. A. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XMLbased,
open standard format for exchanging authentication and
authorization data between parties. OAuth allows an end user’s
account information to be used by third-party services, without
exposing the user’s password. RADIUS is a remote access
protocol. New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) is not XMLbased.
■
198. A. Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) was
designed specifically for this purpose. It periodically
reauthenticates, thus preventing session hijacking. Neither
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) nor TACACS+ prevents
session hijacking, and RADIUS is a protocol for remote access,
not authentication.
■
199. C. IPSec virtual private networks (VPNs) can make a remote
location appear as though it is connected to your local network.
Since Greg needs to rely on a streaming security camera, an
always-on IPSec VPN is the best solution listed. TLS (SSL) VPNs
are primarily used for specific applications, typically focusing on
web applications.
■
200. B. The Opal storage specification defines how to protect
confidentiality for stored user data and how storage devices
from storage device manufacturers can work together. OPAL
does not specify details or processes for licenses, accounts, and
libraries, or degaussers.
■
201. B. UEFI Secure Boot checks every binary that is loaded during
boot to make sure that its hash is valid, by checking against
either a locally trusted certificate or a checksum on an allow list.
It does not protect against worms that might attack those
binaries, nor does it directly check the system BIOS version.
■
202. C. OpenID Connect works with the OAuth 2.0 protocol and
supports multiple clients, including web-based and mobile
clients. OpenID Connect also supports REST. Shibboleth is a
middleware solution for authentication and identity
management that uses SAML (Security Assertion Markup
Language) and works over the Internet. RADIUS is a remote
access protocol. OAuth allows an end user’s account information
to be used by third-party services, without exposing the user’s
password.
■
203. D. Anomaly-based detection systems build a behavioral
baseline for networks and then assess differences from those
baselines. They may use heuristic capabilities on top of those,
but the question specifically asks about baselined operations
pointing to an anomaly-based system. Heuristic-based
detections look for behaviors that are typically malicious, and
signature-based or hash-based detections look for known
malicious tools or files.
■
204. B. A Trusted Platform Module, or TPM, is used as the
foundation for a hardware root of trust for modern PCs. The
TPM may provide a cryptographic key; a PUF, or physically
unclonable function; or a serial number that is unique to the
device. The CPU and hard drive are not used for this function,
and HSMs, or hardware security modules, are used for public
key infrastructure (PKI) and cryptographic purposes but not as a
hardware root of trust for PCs.
■
205. C. Next-generation firewalls typically build in advanced
capabilities like URL filtering, blacklisting, and other
application-layer capabilities beyond simple packet filtering or
stateful packet inspection.
■
206. D. Mobile application management (MAM) tools are
specifically designed for this purpose, and they allow
applications to be delivered to, removed from, and managed on
mobile devices. MOM is the Microsoft Operations Manager, a
systems management tool that Microsoft has replaced with
Operations Manager in current use. MLM often means
multilevel marketing, or pyramid schemes—not a security term.
MIM is not a security term.
■
207. A. Cloud applications have many of the same concerns as onpremises
applications, but compromise of the system running
the application due to local access is a far less likely scenario.
Cloud application vendors are more likely to operate in secure
datacenters with limited or no access to the servers except for
authorized personnel, greatly reducing the likelihood of this type
of security issue.
■
208. D. The most critical part of a certificate authority (CA) is its
root certificate, and ensuring that the root certificate is never
exposed is critical to the ongoing operating of that CA. Thus,
root CAs are often maintained as offline CAs, making it far
harder for an attacker to compromise the system and gain access
to the root certificate. In practice, compromised CAs may lose
the trust of organizations around the world and be unable to
continue to do business.
■
209. C. Split-tunnel VPNs send only traffic destined for the remote
network over the VPN, with all other traffic split away to use the
VPN system or a user’s primary network connection. This
reduces overall traffic sent through the VPN but means that
traffic cannot be monitored and secured via the VPN. Half-pipe
is not a security term, and split horizon is most often used to
describe DNS where an internal and external DNS view may be
different.
■
210. A. Loop protection looks for exactly this type of issue. Loop
protection sends packets that include a PDU, or protocol data
unit. These are detected by other network devices and allow the
network devices to shut down ports from which they receive
those packets. The remaining options were made up for this
question.
■
211. C. Over-the-air (OTA) updates are used by cellular carriers as
well as phone manufacturers to provide firmware updates and
updated phone configuration data. Mobile device management
(MDM) tools can be used to monitor for the current firmware
version and phone settings and will allow Charles to determine if
the phones that his staff use are updated to ensure security. A
network access control (NAC) agent might capture some of this
data but only for network-connected phones, which will not
cover off-site phones, those with Wi-Fi turned off, or remote
devices. OTA is not specifically a way to update encryption keys,
although firmware or settings might include them. OTA is not
sent by the phones themselves.
■
212. C. Open source firewalls typically do not have the same level of
vendor support and maintenance that commercial firewalls do.
That means you don’t have a vendor to turn to if something goes
wrong, and you will be reliant on a support community for
patches and updates. Open source firewalls are typically less
expensive, their open source nature means that the code can be
validated by anybody who cares to examine it, and it can be
acquired as quickly as it can be downloaded.
■
213. C. WPA3 personal replaced PSK, or preshared keys, with SAE,
or simultaneous authentication of equals. SAE helps to prevent
brute-force attacks against keys by making attackers interact
with the network before each authentication attempt. This slows
down brute-force attacks. WPA3 also includes a 192-bit
encryption mode. It does not replace 64-bit encryption with 128-
bit encryption, add per-channel security, or add distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) monitoring and prevention.
■
214. B. Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) allows mandatory
access control for Linux-based systems, and SEAndroid is an
Android implementation of SELinux. That means that Isaac can
use SEAndroid to accomplish his goals. Android does use a
registry, but there is no MAC mode. MACDroid was made up for
this question, and single-user mode does not make Android a
MAC-based system.
■
215. B. The system described is a privileged access management
(PAM) system. PAM systems are used to manage and control
privileged accounts securely. MAC is an access control scheme
that enforces access at the OS level. FDE is full-disk encryption,
and TLS is Transport Layer Security.
■
216. A. Using a mobile device management (MDM) tool that allows
control of the devices would allow Alaina to lock out the
cameras, preventing staff members from using the Android
tablets to take pictures. She would still need to ensure that her
staff did not bring their own camera equipped devices into the
facility. DLP is data loss prevention, OPAL is an encryption
standard for drives, and MMC has a number of meanings,
including multimedia cards and Microsoft Management Console
snap-ins for Windows systems, none of which would provide the
control she needs.
■
217. C. A universal endpoint management (UEM) tool can manage
desktops, laptops, mobile devices, printers, and other devices.
UEM tools often use applications deployed to mobile devices to
configure and manage them, and Olivia’s best option from this
list is a UEM tool. A CASB is a cloud access security broker and
is not used to manage mobile devices, and the other options
require massive amounts of manual work and are unlikely to
succeed—or users will simply change settings when it is
convenient to them.
■
218. C. Next-generation (NG) secure web gateways (SWG) add
additional features beyond those found in cloud access security
brokers and next generation firewalls. While features can vary,
they may include web filtering, TLS decryption to allow traffic
analysis and advanced threat protection, cloud access security
broker (CASB) features, data loss prevention (DLP), and other
advanced capabilities. This type of solution is a relatively new
one, and the market is changing quickly.

219. C. Access policies are built using information and attributes
about access requests. If the policy requirements are met, the
actions like allowing or denying access, or requiring additional
authentication steps can be performed. Geolocation and timebased
logins focus on a single information component, and
account auditing is used to review permissions for accounts, not
to perform this type of validation or policy-based control.
■
220. B. Numeric representations of file permissions are commonly
used instead of using rwx notation with chmod . A 7 sets full
permissions, and the first number sets the user’s rights,
meaning that here the user will be granted full access to the file.
■
221. B. Certificate pinning associates a known certificate with a host
and then compares that known certificate with the certificate
that is presented. This can help prevent man-in-the-middle
attacks but can fail if the certificate is updated and the pinned
certificate isn’t. A CRL, or certificate revocation list, would show
whether the certificate has been revoked, but it would not show
if it was changed. Patrick will not have access to the remote
server’s private key unless he happens to be the administrator.
■
222. C. Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) is the most common format
issued by certificate authorities. Distinguished Encoding Rules
(DER) format is a binary form of the ASCII text PEM format.
PKCS#7 or P7B format is Base64 ASCII, and PKCS#12, or PFX,
format is binary format used to store server certificates,
intermediate certificates, and private keys in a single file.
■
223. C. Michelle’s only option is to remove the certificate from the
list of trusted certificates on every machine that trusted it. This
can be time-consuming and error prone, and it’s one reason selfsigned
certificates are avoided in production at many
organizations.
■
224. D. Changing the IP addresses associated with a domain to an
arbitrary value could cause routing or other problems. That
means that changing the IP address would not be a chosen
method of validating a domain. The remaining options are
legitimate and normal means of validation for certificates.
■
225. A. SNMPv3 adds the ability to authenticate users and groups
and then encrypt messages, providing message integrity and
confidentiality. It does not have SQL injection prevention built
in, but it also isn’t a protocol where SQL injection will typically
be a concern.
■
226. A. This diagram shows a reverse proxy. A reverse proxy takes
connections from the outside world and sends them to an
internal server. A forward proxy takes internal connections and
sends them to external servers. Round-robin and nextgeneration
proxies are not types of proxies, although roundrobin
is a form of load balancing.
