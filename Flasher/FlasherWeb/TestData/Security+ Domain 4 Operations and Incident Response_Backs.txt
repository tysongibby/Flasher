1. A. Mila should select a hash because a hash is designed to be
unique to each possible input. That means that multiple files
could have the same checksum value, whereas a hashing
algorithm will be unique for each file that it is run against.
■
2. A. Allow lists are lists of approved software. Software can only
be installed if it is on an allow list. Deny lists block specific
applications, but they cannot account for every possible
malicious application. Access control lists (ACLs) determine
who can access a resource. A host intrusion detection system
(HIDS) does not prevent software from being installed.
■
3. C. Correlation dashboards are used to aggregate events and to
seek out connections. In some cases, this is done with advanced
analytic algorithms, including artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning (ML). A network intrusion detection system
(NIDS) would be helpful but will not (by itself) necessarily
correlate events. A public key infrastructure (PKI) handles
certificates, not correlation and visibility of security events.
Trend dashboards would show how things are going and which
way statistics and information are moving.
■
4. D. Using tcpdump with flags like -i to set the interface, tcp to set
the protocol, and port to set the port will capture exactly the
traffic Emily needs to capture. Port 443 is the default HTTPS
port. There is no -proto flag for tcpdump .
■
5. A. Tabletop exercises are used to talk through a process. Unlike
walk-throughs, which focus on step-by-step review of an
incident, Mila will focus more on how her team responds and on
learning from those answers. A tabletop exercise can involve
gaming out a situation. A simulation actually emulates an event
or incident, either on a small or a large scale. Drills are not
defined as part of the Security+ exam outline.
■
6. A. Backups are considered to be the least volatile type of
storage since they change at a much slower pace and, in fact,
may be intentionally retained for long periods of time without
changing. In this list, CPU cache will change the most
frequently, then RAM, then local disk contents.
■
7. C. Incident responders know that scan results can show
vulnerable systems and services, providing clues about how
attackers may have obtained access to systems. The scans will
not show the programs the attackers used but may show services
that they have enabled or changed. The scans will show the
versions of software installed before the attack, but that
information is only useful if the attackers either upgraded or
changed the software or the software was vulnerable, making
this a less accurate and useful answer. Finally, the scans may
show where network security devices are, but that information
should be available to the incident response team without trying
to figure it out from scans.
■
8. C. After eradication of the issue has been completed, recovery
can begin. Recovery can include restoration of services and a
return to normal operations.
■
9. C. The -p flag adds a persistent route when combined with the
ADD command. Persistent routes will remain in the routing table
between boots. By default, they are cleared at each boot. An
attacker may choose to use this to help with an on-path (man-inthe-
middle) attack.
■
10. D. Of the options provided, only theHarvester is an open source
intelligence tool. Curl is a tool used to transfer data, hping is a
tool that is frequently used to build custom packets and to
perform packet analyzer functions, and netcat is a utility that
allows you to read and write to network connections, making it a
broadly used tool for pen testers and attackers who need to
transfer data using a small, capable utility.
■
11. C. The MITRE ATT&CK framework focuses on techniques and
tactics and does not focus on a specific order of operations like
the Cyber Kill Chain does. It also covers a broader range of
techniques and adversaries than the Diamond Model does and is
broadly implemented in many existing tools. The CVSS standard
is a vulnerability scoring system and is not a useful framework
for analyzing malware and attacks.
■
12. D. To properly preserve the system, Ted needs to ensure that it
does not change. Turning the system off will cause anything in
memory to be lost, which may be needed for the investigation.
Removing the drive while a system is running can cause data to
be lost. Instead, live imaging the machine and its memory may
be required. Allowing users to continue to use a machine will
result in changes, which can also damage Ted’s ability to
perform a forensic investigation.
■
13. D. Containment efforts are used to limit the spread or impact of
an incident. Containment may focus on keeping systems or
services online to ensure that organizations can continue to
function until other options for business continuity can be
implemented. Segmentation moves systems or services into
different security zones, and isolation removes them from all
contact or puts them in small groups that are removed from the
rest of the organization and systems that are not impacted.
■
14. D. Windows does not log network traffic at a level of
granularity that will show if a file has been uploaded. Basic
traffic statistics can be captured, but without additional sensors
and information gathering capabilities, Jessica will not be able
to determine if files are sent from a Windows system.
■
15. C. The chain of custody in forensic activities tracks who has a
device, data, or other forensic artifact at any time, when
transfers occur, who performed analysis, and where the item,
system, or device goes when the forensic process is done.
Evidence logs may be maintained by law enforcement to track
evidence that is gathered. Paper trail and digital footprint are
not technical terms used for digital forensics.
■
16. A. Of the listed tools, only nmap is a port scanner, and thus it is
the tool that will provide the required information. route is a
command-line tool to view and add network traffic routes. hping
is a packet generator and analyzer, and netstat is a commandline
tool that shows network connections, interface statistics,
and other useful information about a system’s network usage.
■
17. B. The -c flag for grep counts the number of occurrences for a
given string in a file. The -n flag shows the matched lines and
line numbers. Even if you’re not sure about which flag is which,
the syntax should help on a question like this. When using grep ,
the pattern comes before the filename, allowing you to rule out
two of the options right away.
■
18. B. Stakeholder management involves working with
stakeholders, or those who have an interest in the event or
impacted systems or services. COOP, or Continuity of
Operations Planning, is a U.S. federal government effort to
ensure that federal agencies have continuity plans. PAM is
privileged account management. Stakeholder management
involves more than just communications, although
communications is an important part of it.
■
19. D. The most common reason for a one-hour time offset
between two systems in the same location is a faulty time zone
setting creating a time offset between the systems.
■
20. C. DNS data is frequently logged to help identify compromised
systems or systems that have visited known phishing sites. DNS
logs can be used along with IP reputation and known bad
hostname lists to identify issues like these. DNS data is not
commonly used to identify network scans and cannot capture
them. Domain transfers are not attacks, although they are
information gathering and will show in the logs. DNS does not
capture information about logins.
■
21. D. Even if you’re not deeply familiar with the openssl
command-line utility, you should know that certificates use
ciphers that accept a bit length as a flag and that bit lengths like
1024, 2048, and 4096 are common. These key lengths are not
commonly communicated in bytes, and certificates are unlikely
to last for multiple decades, although a certificate authority (CA)
root certificate can last for a long time.
■
22. B. By default, the tail command shows the last 10 lines of a
file, and using the -f flag follows changes in the file. head shows
the top of a file, and foot and follow were made up for this
question.
■
23. B. Although firmware acquisition is a less commonly used
technique, firmware is typically stored in a chip on a system
board rather than on disk. Henry is most likely to succeed if he
retrieves the running firmware from memory. A serial
connection may work but would typically require rebooting the
system.
■
24. B. Network flows using NetFlow or sFlow would provide the
information that Eric wants, with details of how much traffic
was used, when, and where traffic was directed. A firewall or
data loss prevention (DLP) would not show the bandwidth
detail, although a firewall may show the connection information
for events. Packetflow was made up for this question and is not a
technology used for this purpose.
■
25. D. Hashing using MD5 or SHA1 is commonly used to validate
that a forensic image matches the original drive. Many forensic
duplicators automatically generate a hash of both drives when
they complete the imaging process to ensure that there is a
documentation chain for the forensic artifacts. A third image
may be useful but does not validate this. Directory listings do
not prove that drives match, and photos, though useful to
document the drives and serial numbers, do not validate the
contents of the drives.
■
26. B. Nessus is a popular vulnerability scanning tool. It is not a
fuzzer, web application firewall (WAF), or protocol analyzer.
■
27. A. Of the options listed, the only requirement for admissibility
is that the evidence must be relevant. Evidence must also be
authenticated, meaning that it needs to be genuine.
■
28. D. The cost to the organization is not typically a part of
communications planning. Since incidents can have a broad
range of costs, and since exposing those costs can cause worry or
a loss of customer confidence in the worst case, the costs of the
incident are relatively rarely exposed as part of the incident
response process. Communications with customers and
employees is critical, and having different communication plans
for different event severities helps ensure that appropriate
communications occur.
■
29. B. The cat command without an angle bracket to redirect it will
simply display the contents of the files listed. Thus, this
command will display file1.txt , and then file2.txt . If Rick
had inserted > between the two files, it would have appended
file1.txt to file2.txt .
■
30. D. CentOS and Red Hat both store authentication log
information in /var/log/secure instead of /var/log/auth.log
used by Debian and Ubuntu systems. Knowing the differences
between the major distributions can help speed up your forensic
and incident investigations, and consistency is one of the
reasons that organizations often select a single Linux
distribution for their infrastructure whenever it is possible to do
so.
■
31. B. Web page titles, as well as headers like meta tags, are
examples of metadata about a page and are frequently used to
gather information about web pages and websites. Headers are
used as part of a page’s design and typically describe the bar at
the top of the page used for site navigation. Summary and
hidden data are not technical terms used to describe web page
components.
■
32. C. Cuckoo , or Cuckoo Sandbox, is a malware analysis sandbox
that will safely run malware and then analyze and report on its
behavior. strings is a command-line tool that retrieves strings
from binary data. scanless is a tool described as a port scraper,
which retrieves port information without running a port scan by
using websites and services to run the scan for you. Sn1per is a
pen test framework.
■
33. C. Although Autopsy, strings , and grep can all be used to
retrieve information from files, exiftool is the only purposebuilt
file metadata retrieval tool listed.
■
34. B. FTK Imager is a free tool that can image both systems and
memory, allowing Isaac to capture the information he wants.
Although dd is useful for capturing disks, other tools are
typically used for memory dumps, and though dd can be used on
a Windows system, FTK Imager is a more likely choice. Autopsy
is a forensic analysis tool and does not provide its own imaging
tools. WinDump is a Windows version of tcpdump , a protocol
analyzer.
■
35. B. When artifacts are acquired as part of an investigation, they
should be logged and documented as part of the evidence related
to the investigation. Artifacts could include a piece of paper with
passwords on it, tools or technology related to an exploit or
attack, smartcards, or any other element of an investigation.
■
36. A. The MX records for a domain list its email servers. Gary can
use nslookup to query Domain Name System (DNS) for the MX
servers using the command nslookup -query =mx example.com to
look up example.com’s email server. ping does not support MX
server lookups, and both smtp and email are not command-line
tools.
■
37. B. Wireshark can be used to capture and analyze live Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) traffic on a network. Analysts should
keep the fact that SIP traffic may be encrypted on their network
and that they may need to take additional steps to fully view the
content of SIP packets. Log files can provide information about
SIP sessions and events and are useful for analysis after the fact,
but they won’t provide the same detail about live SIP traffic.
Nessus is a vulnerability scanner, and SIPper was made up for
this question.
■
38. A. Although all of the tools listed can perform a port scan and
identify open ports, netcat is the only one that does not also
integrate automated service identification.
■
39. D. Forensic reports should include appropriate technical detail.
Analysis of a system does not include a picture of the person
from whom the system was acquired.
■
40. A. This question tests your knowledge of both the common
Linux logs and basic format information for the auth.log file.
Greg could use grep to search for "Failed password" in the
auth.log file found in /var/log on many Linux systems. There is
not a common log file named bruteforce.log ; tail and head are
not useful for searching through the file, only for showing a set
number of lines; and /etc/ is not the normal location for the
auth.log file.
■
41. C. The browser cache, history, and session information will all
contain information from recently visited sites. Bookmarks may
indicate sites that a user has visited at some point, but a
bookmark can be added without visiting a site at all.
■
42. C. Wireshark is a packet analyzer that can be used to capture
and analyze network traffic for forensic purposes. Unlike disk
forensics, network forensics require forethought and intentional
capture of data before it is needed since traffic is ephemeral.
Organizations that want to have a view of network traffic
without capturing all traffic might use NetFlow or sFlow to
provide some information about network traffic patterns and
usage. Nessus is a vulnerability scanner, nmap is a port scanner,
and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a
protocol used to transfer and gather information about network
devices and status.
■
43. A. Mapping networks using ping relies on pinging each host,
and then uses time-to-live (TTL) information to determine how
many hops exist between known hosts and devices inside a
network. When TTLs decrease, another router or switch
typically exists between you and the device. Packets sent and
received can be used to determine if there are issues with the
path or link, and transit time can provide information about
relative network distance or the path used, but traceroute
provides far more useful detail in that case.
■
44. C. Organizations define retention policies for different data
types and systems. Many organizations use 30-, 45-, 90-, 180-,
or 365-day retention policies, with some information required to
be kept longer due to law or compliance reasons. Susan’s
organization may keep logs for as little as 30 days depending on
storage limitations and business needs. Data classification
policies typically impact how data is secured and handled.
Backup policies determine how long backups are retained and
rotated and may have an impact on data if the logs are backed
up, but backing up logs are a less common practice due to the
space they take up versus the value of having logs backed up.
Legal hold practices are common, but policies are less typically
defined for legal holds since requirements are set by law.
■
45. C. Zero-wiping a drive can be accomplished using dd , and
when this command is completed Selah will have written zeroes
to the entire drive /dev/sda .
■
46. C. Involving impacted areas, or those that have a role in the
process, is part of stakeholder management and ensures that
those who need to be involved or aware of the incident response
process are engaged throughout the process. Laws rarely have
specific requirements for internal involvement, instead focusing
on customers or those whose data is involved in an incident.
Retention policies determine what data is kept and for how long.
COOP is Continuity of Operations Planning, a federal effort to
ensure disaster recovery and business continuity plans are in
place for federal agencies.
■
47. A. A simulation is the closest you can get to a real-world event
without having one. A tabletop exercise has personnel
discussing scenarios, whereas a walk-through goes through
checklists and procedures. A wargame is not a common exercise
type.
■
48. C. The Content-Addressable Memory (CAM) tables on switches
contain a list of all the devices they have talked to and will give
Erin the best chance of identifying the devices on the network.
Wireshark and netstat will only have a view of the devices that
the system she is working from communicate with or that
broadcast on the network segment she is on. Domain Name
System (DNS) will list only systems that have a DNS entry. In
most organizations, relatively few systems will have entries in
DNS.
■
49. C. Sensors are deployed, either as agents, hardware, or virtual
machines to gather information to relay it back to a security
information and event management (SIEM) device. Alert levels,
trend analysis features, and sensitivity thresholds are all used to
analyze and report on data, not to gather data.
■
50. C. A quarantine process or setting will preserve malicious or
dangerous files and programs without allowing them to run.
This allows defenders to retrieve them for further analysis as
well as to return them to use if they are determined not to be
malicious, or if the malicious components can be removed from
needed files. Purging, deep-freezing, and retention are not terms
used to describe this behavior or setting.
■
51. C. Chuck should recommend a mobile device management
(MDM) system to ensure that organizational devices can be
managed and protected in the future. Data loss prevention
(DLP) will not stop a lost phone from being a potential leak of
data, isolating the phones is not a realistic scenario for devices
that will actually be used, nor is containment because the phone
is out of the organization’s control once lost.
■
52. A. A content filter is specifically designed to allow
organizations to select both specific sites and categories of
content that should be blocked. Gabby could review content
categories and configure the filter to prevent students from
browsing to the unwanted sites. A data loss prevention (DLP)
solution is designed to prevent data loss, a firewall can block IP
addresses or hostnames but would require additional
functionality to filter content, and an intrusion detection system
(IDS) can detect unwanted traffic but cannot stop it.
■
53. B. Information stored on a disk drive is one of the least volatile
items in the order of volatility, but backups are even less volatile.
That means Frank should capture backups after he images the
disk drive and that he should capture CPU cache and registers as
well as system RAM first if he needs them.
■
54. C. The -R flag applies the permission recursively to all files in
the named directory. Here, the permissions are 7 , which sets the
owner to read, write, and execute, and 55 , which sets group and
then world permissions to read only. 755 is a very commonly
used permission on Linux systems.
■
55. B. The most important action Charles can take while working
with his forensic artifacts to provide nonrepudiation is to
digitally sign the artifacts and information that he is creating in
his evidence records. Encrypting the output will ensure its
confidentiality but will not provide nonrepudiation by itself.
MD5 checksums for images are commonly gathered but must
then be signed so that they can be validated to ensure they have
not been modified.
■
56. D. The memdump tool is a command-line memory dump utility
that can dump physical memory. Somewhat confusingly,
memdump is also a flag in the very useful Volatility framework,
where it can be used to dump memory as well. The remaining
options were made up and are not Linux tools, although you can
create a ramdump on Android devices.
■
57. B. The Windows swapfile is pagefile.sys and is saved in the
root of the C:\ drive by default.
■
58. A. The best way to capture a virtual machine from a running
hypervisor is usually to use the built-in tools to obtain a
snapshot of the system. Imaging tools are not typically capable
of capturing machine state, and dd is not designed to capture
VMs. Removing a server’s drives can be challenging due to RAID
and other specific server configuration items, and doing so
might impact all other running VMs and services on the system.
■
59. C. A well-documented chain of custody can help establish
provenance for data, proving where it came from, who handled
it, and how it was obtained. Right to audit, timelines, and
preservation of images do not establish provenance, although
preservation is part of the chain of custody process.
■
60. B. Digital forensics techniques are commonly used to analyze
attack patterns, tools, and techniques used by advanced
persistent threat (APT) actors for counterintelligence purposes.
They may sometimes be used to determine what information
was stolen, but this is not the most common use for digital
forensic techniques, nor is their use as a training mechanism.
■
61. A. Law enforcement is not typically part of organizational
incident response teams, but incident response teams often
maintain a relationship with local law enforcement officers.
Security analysts, management, and communication staff as well
as technical experts are all commonly part of a core incident
response team.
■
62. A. Even if you’re not familiar with iptables , you can read
through these rules and guess which rule includes the right
details. DROP makes sense for a block, and you should know that
SSH will be a TCP service on port 22.
■
63. C. logger is a Linux utility that will add information to the
Linux syslog. It can accept file input, write to the system journal
entry, send to remote syslog servers, and perform a variety of
other functions. The other commands do not directly interface
with the system log.
■
64. A. Incident response plans don’t stop incidents from occurring,
but they do help responders react appropriately, prepare the
organization for incidents, and may be required for legal or
compliance reasons.
■
65. D. Degaussing a drive uses strong magnetic fields to wipe it and
is the least likely to result in recoverable data. Deleted files can
often be recovered because only the file index information will
be removed until that space is needed and is overwritten. Quick
formats work in a similar way and will leave remnant data, and
files that are overwritten by smaller files will also leave
fragments of data that can be recovered and analyzed.
■
66. D. Henry’s most likely use for the video is to document the
forensic process, part of the chain of custody and provenance of
the forensic data he acquires. The order of volatility helps
determine what devices or drives he would image first. There is
no crime being committed, so establishing guilt is not relevant
to this scenario, and the video will not ensure data is preserved
on a drive during a forensic process.
■
67. B. WinHex is the only disk editor in this list. Autopsy is a
forensic analysis suite; dd and FTK Imager are both imaging
tools. WinHex also provides the ability to read RAID and
dynamic disks, perform data recovery, edit physical memory,
clone disks, wipe files and drives, and a variety of other
functions.
■
68. B. Playbooks list the required steps that are needed to address
an incident. A runbook focuses on the steps to perform an action
or process as part of an incident response process. Thus, a
playbook may reference runbooks. Business continuity (BC)
plans and disaster recovery (DR) plans are not used for incident
response, but they are used to ensure that a business stays
online or can recover from a disaster.
■
69. C. Passwords are typically stored using a hash, and best
practices would have them stored using a password security–
specific hash. Alaina can speed up her efforts if she knows what
hashing algorithm and options were used on the passwords. The
age and length of the passwords are not necessary, and
passwords should not be stored in encrypted form—but the
question also specifically notes they’re hashed passwords.
■
70. D. An application block list would fit Vincent’s needs the best
from the list provided. An approved list would prevent other
tools from being installed, which may impede functionality
while making the maintenance of the list challenging. A data loss
prevention (DLP) solution attempts to prevent data from being
sent or exposed but does not prevent installations or downloads
of games. A content filter might help, but workarounds are easy,
including sending games via email or via a thumb drive.
■
71. B. IPSec is not a tool used to capture network flows. sFlow,
NetFlow, and IPFIX are all used to capture network flow
information, which will provide the information Charlene needs.
■
72. C. A system crash, or system dump, file contains the contents of
memory at the time of the crash. The infamous Windows blue
screen of death results in a memory dump to a file, allowing
analysis of memory contents. The swapfile (pagefile) is used to
store information that would not fit in memory but is unlikely to
contain a currently running malware package, since files are
swapped out when they are not in use. The Windows security log
does not contain this type of information, nor does the system
log.
■
73. C. The Windows tracert command will show the route to a
remote system as well as delays along the route. traceroute is
the equivalent command in Linux. The arp command allows you
to view and modify the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
cache in Windows, and netstat has varying functions in
different operating systems but generally shows statistics and
information about network usage and status.
■
74. B. PRTG and Cacti are both network monitoring tools that can
provide bandwidth monitoring information. Bandwidth
monitors can help identify exfiltration, heavy and abnormal
bandwidth usage, and other information that can be helpful for
both incident identification and incident investigations. If you
encounter a question like this on the exam, even if you’re not
familiar with either tool, you can use your knowledge of what
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used for to
identify which of the categories is most likely correct.
■
75. D. The Security+ exam outline focuses on right to audit clauses,
regulatory and jurisdictional issues, and data breach notification
laws as key elements to consider when planning on-site versus
cloud forensic differences. Provenance is important regardless of
where the forensic activity occurs.
■
76. A. A variety of configuration changes could be pushed to
mobile devices to help: setting passcodes, enabling full-disk
encryption (FDE) on mobile devices via organizationally
deployed mobile device management (MDM), or even
preventing some sensitive files from being downloaded or kept
on those devices could all help. Firewall rules, data loss
prevention (DLP) rules, and URL filters will not prevent a stolen
device from being accessed and the data being exposed.
■
77. B. The @ command for dig selects the Domain Name System
(DNS) server it should query. In this case, it will query one of
Google’s DNS servers at 8.8.8.8 for the DNS information for
example.com.
■
78. C. Greg should use the built-in hashing functions to compare
either an MD5 or SHA-1 hash of the source drive to a hash using
the same function run on the image. If they match, he has a valid
and intact image. None of the other answers will provide
validation that the full drive was properly imaged.
■
79. B. The Linux grep command is a search tool that Adam can use
to search through files or directories to find strings. cat is short
for concatenate, and the command can be used to create files, to
view their contents, or to combine files. head and tail are used
to view the beginning or end of a file, respectively.
■
80. C. Segmentation splits networks or systems into smaller units
that align with specific needs. Segmentation can be functional,
security based, or for other purposes. Removing potentially
infected systems would be an example of isolation, using
firewalls and other tools to stop the spread of an infection is
containment, and adding security systems to prevent data loss is
an example of implementing a security tool or feature.
■
81. B. Unlike a disaster recovery plan that is written to help an
organization recovery from a person-made or natural disaster, a
business continuity plan focuses on how to keep the business
running when it is disrupted. Thus, Charlene’s BC plan would
detail how to keep the organization running when a system
outage occurs.
■
82. C. OpenSSL can be used to generate a certificate using a
command like this:
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048
-keyout
privateKey.key -out certificate.crt.
None of the other tools listed can be used to generate a
certificate.
■
83. A. The only password cracker listed is John the Ripper. John
accepts custom wordlists, meaning that Cameron can create and
use his own wordlist, as shown in option A.
■
84. A. Autopsy does not have a built-in capability to create disk
images. Instead, it relies on third-party tools for acquisition and
then imports disk images and other media. Autopsy has built-in
timeline generation, image filtering and identification, and
communication visualization, among many other capabilities.
■
85. C. Many cloud service providers do not allow customer-driven
audits, either by the customer or a third party. They also
commonly prohibit vulnerability scans of their production
environment to avoid service outages. Instead, many provide
third-party audit results in the form of a service organization
controls (SOC) report or similar audit artifact.
■
86. B. The Cyber Kill Chain moves to privilege escalation after
exploitation. The entire kill chain is: 1) Reconnaissance, 2)
Intrusion, 3) Exploitation, 4) Privilege Escalation, 5) Lateral
Movement, 6) Obfuscation/Anti-forensics, 7) Denial of Service,
and 8) Exfiltration.
■
87. D. Of the tools that are listed, only Metasploit is an exploitation
framework. Cuckoo is a malware testing sandbox, theHarvester
is an open source intelligence gathering tool, and Nessus is a
vulnerability scanner. Tools like Metasploit, BeEF, and Pacu are
all examples of exploitation frameworks.
■
88. A. A playbook for a security orchestration, automation, and
response (SOAR) environment is a set of rules that determine
what actions will be performed when an event occurs that is
identified by the SOAR using data it collects or receives.
■
89. B. The Security+ exam outline uses a six-step process for
incident response: Preparation, Identification, Containment,
Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.
■
90. D. A disaster recovery plan addresses what to do during a
person-made or natural disaster. A flood that completely fills a
datacenter would require significant efforts to recover from, and
Gurvinder will need a solid disaster recovery plan—and perhaps
a new datacenter location as soon as possible! A COOP, or
Continuity of Operations Pan, is needed for U.S. government
agencies but is not required for businesses. A business
continuity plan would cover how to keep business running, but
it does not cover all the requirements in a natural disaster of this
scale, and a flood insurance plan is not a term used in the
Security+ exam.
■
91. C. pathping combines both ping and tracert / traceroute style
functionality to help identify both the path used and where
latency is an issue. It is built into Windows and can be used for
exactly the troubleshooting that Frank needs to accomplish. He
could use both ping and tracert / traceroute to perform the
task, but he would need to spend more time using each tool in
turn to identify the same information that pathping will put into
a single interface. netcat , while useful for many tasks, isn’t as
well suited to this one.
■
92. A. The dnsenum tool can perform many Domain Name System
(DNS)-related functions, including querying A records,
nameservers, and MX records, as well as performing zone
transfers, Google searches for hosts and subdomains, and net
range reverse lookups. dig and host are useful for DNS queries
but do not provide this range of capabilities, and dnscat was
made up for this question.
■
93. C. Jill wants the least possible changes to occur on the system,
so she should instruct the user to not save any files or make any
changes. Rebooting the system will not create a memory dump,
and may cause new files to be written or changed if patches were
waiting to install or other changes are set to occur during a
reboot. Turning off secure delete or making other changes will
not impact the files that were deleted prior to that setting
change.
■
94. C. Anti-forensics activities follow lateral movement in the
Cyber Kill Chain model. It helps to remember that after an
attacker has completed their attack, they will attempt to hide
traces of their efforts, and then may proceed to denial-of-service
or exfiltration activities in the model.
■
95. B. The IR process used for the Security+ exam outline is
Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication,
Recovery, and Lessons Learned. Veronica should move into the
lessons learned phase.
■
96. C. Quick formatting merely deletes file indexes rather than
removing and overwriting files, making it inappropriate for
sanitization. Physical destruction will ensure that the data is not
readable, as will degaussing and zero wiping.
■
97. D. Microsoft Office places information like the name of the
creator of the file, editors, creation and change dates, and other
useful information in the file metadata that is stored in each
Office document. Bart can simply open the Office document to
review this information or can use a forensic or file metadata
tool to review it. Filenames may contain the creator’s name, but
this would only be if the creator included it. Microsoft Office
does not create or maintain a log, and the application log for
Windows does not contain this information.
■
98. B. Windows Defender Firewall operates on a per-application
model and can filter traffic based on whether the system is on a
trusted private network or a public network. Nathaniel should
allow Chrome by name in the firewall, which will allow it to send
traffic without needing to specify ports or protocols.
■
99. B. The dnsenum Perl script builds in quite a few Domain Name
System (DNS) enumeration capabilities, including host,
nameserver, and MX record gathering; zone transfer; Google
scraping for domains; subdomain brute forcing from files; as
well as Whois automation and reverse lookups for networks up to
class C in size. Although you could manually use dig or nslookup
or even netcat to perform many of these functions, dnsenum is
the only automated tool on the list.
■
100. B. Building a timeline, particularly from multiple systems,
relies on accurately set system clocks or adding a manually
configured offset. Disk hashing and acquisition does not need an
accurate system clock, and file metadata can be reviewed even
without an accurate clock, although accurate clock information
or knowing the offset can be useful for analysis.
■
101. B. Data breach notification laws often build in a maximum
length of time that can pass before notification is required. They
also often include a threshold for notification, with a maximum
number of exposed individuals before the state or other
authorities must be notified. They do not include a maximum
number of individuals who can be notified, nor do they typically
have specific requirements about police involvement in forensic
investigations or certification types or levels.
■
102. C. A data loss prevention (DLP) tool that can scan and review
emails for SSN style data is the most effective tool listed here.
Naomi may want to set the tool to block all emails with potential
SSNs, and then review those emails manually to ensure that no
further emails leave while allowing legitimate emails to pass
through. An intrusion detection system (IDS) might look
tempting as an answer, but an IDS can only detect, not stop, the
traffic, which would allow the SSNs to exit the organization.
Antimalware and firewalls will not stop this type of event.
■
103. C. Email headers contain a significant amount of metadata,
including where the email was sent from. The from: field lists a
sender but does not indicate where the email was actually sent
from. The to: field lists who the email was sent to, and footers
are not used to store this information for email.
■
104. A. Jurisdictional boundaries exist between states and localities,
as well as countries, making it challenging for local law
enforcement to execute warrants and acquire data from
organizations outside of their jurisdiction in many cases. Venue
is used to describe where a legal case is conducted. Legislation
may or may not have an impact, and breach laws are unlikely to
impact this but would guide Henry about when notifications of a
breach would need to occur.
■
105. A. Olivia should use John the Ripper. Although both John the
Ripper and rainbow table tools like Ophcrack can be used to
crack passwords, John the Ripper will provide a better view of
how hard the password was to crack, whereas rainbow table
tools will simply determine if the password hash can be cracked.
Crack.it and TheHunter were made up for this question.
■
106. B. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), part
of the Department of Homeland Security, is in charge of
Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP), which is a
requirement for federal agencies. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and
the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) are not in charge of
Continuity of Operations Planning.
■
107. B. Windows configuration data can be queried using
PowerShell, allowing Elaine to write scripts that will gather
security configuration data. Bash is a shell used for Linux
systems. Although Windows systems can now run Bash in the
Linux subsystem, it isn’t installed by default. Secure Shell (SSH)
is used for remote shell access, and Python could be used but
would need to be installed specifically for this purpose and isn’t
available by default.
■
108. C. The best option listed is a Wireshark capture of traffic from
the phone. In some cases, this traffic may be encrypted, and
Ramon may need to take additional steps to decrypt the data.
Call manager logs and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) logs do
not include the full audio of a conversation.
■
109. C. NXLog is a log collection and centralization tool. IPFIX,
NetFlow, and sFlow all gather data about network traffic,
including source, destination, port, protocol, and amount of data
sent to be collected.
■
110. A. Pete has isolated the system by placing it on a separate
logical network segment without access. Some malware can
detect if systems lose their network connection, and Pete may
want to perform forensics via the network or monitor attempts
to send outbound traffic, meaning that simply unplugging the
system may not meet his needs. Containment would involve
limiting the spread or impact of an attack, segmentation places
systems in groups based on rules or security groupings, and
eradication is a part of the incident response (IR) process where
components of an incident or attack are removed.
■
111. C. Virtual machine forensics typically rely on a snapshot
gathered using the underlying virtualization environment’s
snapshot capabilities. This will capture both memory state and
the disk for the system and can be run on an independent
system or analyzed using forensic tools.
■
112. B. The tcpreplay tool is specifically designed to allow PCAP
capture files to be replayed to a network, allowing exactly this
type of testing. hping can be used to craft packets, but it’s not
designed to replay capture files. tcpdump is used to capture
packets, but again, it not a replay tool, and Cuckoo is a
sandboxing tool for testing and identifying malware packages.
■
113. C. Windows creates a dump file, which contains all the contents
of active memory to allow analysis of the crash.
■
114. D. Segmenting a network based on security or risk levels helps
ensure that attacks and compromises are constrained to the
same type of systems or devices with similar levels of security
requirements. Isolation would remove a device or system from
contact with the network or other systems. Fragmentation and
tiering are not terms used for the Security+ exam.
■
115. A. Tagging each drive helps with inventory and ensures that the
drive is tracked properly and that the chain of custody can be
maintained. Taking a picture may be useful to identify the drive,
but tagging and inventory control are more important. Drives
are not labeled with an order of volatility because the order of
volatility is associated with the type of forensic target, not with a
specific drive. Interviews may be useful but are not always
conducted with every person whose machine is imaged.
■
116. B. The provenance of a forensic artifact includes the chain of
custody, including ownership and acquisition of the artifact,
device, or image. E-discovery is the process of doing discovery in
electronic formats for litigation, investigations, and records
requests. Jurisdiction is the region or area where laws or law
enforcement has authority. Volatility is how likely a device or
component is to change.
■
117. B. The Volatility framework is a purpose-built tool for the
acquisition of random access memory (RAM) from a live system.
Autopsy is a forensic tool for drive analysis and forensic
investigations, dd is used to image drives, and netcat is a tool
used to transfer data or to make connections to systems across a
network.
■
118. D. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer and capture tool
that can be used for troubleshooting in circumstances like this.
In fact, security practitioners are often asked to verify that traffic
is being received properly as part of firewall rule
troubleshooting. Randy may want to capture traffic at both ends
of the communication to make sure that the clients are sending
traffic properly and then to match that to the same traffic being
received—or going missing—at the other end. tracert and
traceroute are useful for validating the route that traffic takes
but would not show if HTTPS packets were being blocked, and
Sn1per is a pen test framework that allows automated pen
testing.
■
119. B. The oldest and least capable tool listed is syslog, the original
system logging tool for Linux and Unix systems. The other three
options have advanced features, which mean that they are more
broadly implemented when flexibility and reliability are needed.
■
120. A. The only tool on this list that can be used to craft packets is
hping . Susan could use the sample code or exploit by building
the necessary packet with hping and then sending it to a
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server in her
network while monitoring with her intrusion prevention system
(IPS). She may want to capture all of her traffic with Wireshark
or tcpdump to observe what happens on both ends too!
■
121. D. SQL injection attempts are sent as HTTP or HTTPS requests
to a web server, meaning that Valerie will be able to see the
attacks in the web server log. Domain Name System (DNS) logs,
if available, will not show these. Auth logs show logins, not web
or SQL Server queries or requests. Unlike Windows, there is no
security log file for Linux, although there is a secure log for some
systems.
■
122. A. If the private key and the passphrase for a certificate are
exposed, the certificate should be revoked. A new certificate will
need to be issued, but the certificate cannot be trusted and
revocation is the first step to handle the issue properly.
Changing the password will not help, and changing the private
or public key will require a new certificate.
■
123. C. A legal hold notice will inform the company that they must
preserve and protect information related to the case. None of the
other items are terms used in this process.
124. B. netstat can show all active connections, and using the -a
flag will do so. netstat does not provide a -c command flag. The
route command is used to modify and display the system’s
routing table. hping is a packet analyzer and packet building tool
often used to craft specific packets as part of penetration tests
and attacks.
■
125. B. A quarantine setting will place a malicious or suspect file in a
safe location and will keep it there until a set timeframe has
passed or until an administrator takes action to deal with it. This
can allow you to further analyze the file or to restore it if it was
an incorrect identification or if the file is needed for another
purpose. Containment is used to limit the extent of an incident
or attack, isolation keeps a system or device from connecting to
or accessing others, and deleting a file wouldn’t keep it around.
■
126. D. Although Linux systems can use a file for swap space, a
common solution is to use a separate partition for swap space.
127. A. Tracking multiple drives requires careful inventory, evidence
handling logging, and tagging of the drives to ensure that they
are the right drive and that they are tracked throughout the
forensic investigation. Marco should carefully tag each of the
drives and ensure that those tags are used throughout the
investigation.
■
128. D. The -v flag for netcat sets it to verbose mode. That means
that Isaac has attempted to connect to every port from 1 to 1024
on 10.11.10.1 using netcat . Since there are no other flags or
options, it will simply try to connect, and then provide a verbose
result about what happened, resulting in a simple but effective
port scan.
■
129. B. Tony’s best option is likely containment. He may want to
remove that location from the corporate network or to prevent
most traffic from being permitted until he can take a deeper look
into what is going on. If he isolated the entire site, he might
disrupt critical business operations, and segmentation would
have been more appropriate before the event occurred.
■
130. C. Right-to-audit clauses are commonly accepted as part of
service and leasing contracts regardless of location for
datacenter co-location and facility rental contracts. Cloud
service providers, however, are less likely to sign a right-to-audit
contract. Instead, they may provide third-party audit data to
customers or even to potential customers.
■
131. D. The best option for Alaina would be to use a URL filter to
block users from visiting the link in the phishing email. A WAF,
or web application firewall, is designed to prevent attacks
against a web application. Patching can help stop exploits of
vulnerable services or systems, but this is a phishing attack, and
an allow list lists allowed items, not blocked items, and limiting
which websites an entire company can visit is almost impossible
in most circumstances.
■
132. A. Playbooks list the actions that an organization will take as
part of a response process. A runbook lists the steps required to
perform an action like notification, removing malware, or
similar tasks. Playbooks tend to be used to document processes,
whereas runbooks tend to be used for specific actions. A disaster
recovery (DR) plan is used to recover from disasters, and a
business continuity (BC) plan is used to ensure that the
organization continues to function.
■
133. B. Since MAC addresses are only visible within a broadcast
domain (local network), the MAC addresses of external hosts
cannot be retrieved using the arp command. The MAC addresses
for local systems, the IP addresses of the local host, and whether
they are dynamic or static can all be determined using the arp
command.
■
134. C. The journalctl tool is used to query the systemd journal. On
systemd-enabled Linux distributions, the journal contains
kernel and boot messages as well as syslog messages and
messages from services.
■
135. C. The recovery phase often involves adding firewall rules and
patching systems in addition to rebuilding systems. Although
preparation may involve configuring firewall rules or regular
patching, it does not do so in response to an incident.
Containment might involve both but is less likely to, since the
focus will be on broader fixes, and eradication works to remove
the threat.
■
136. A. The curl command-line tool supports downloads and
uploads from a wide variety of services, and it would be the ideal
solution for this scenario. hping is used for crafting packets, nmap
is a port scanner, and theHarvester is an open source
intelligence gathering tool, none of which meet Gary’s needs.
■
137. C. Gary should look at the trend information for malware
detections to check to see if there are more infections being
detected than during recent weeks. This can be a useful
indicator of a change, either due to a new malware technique or
package, a successful attack that has resulted in staff members
clicking on malicious links or opening malicious emails, or other
paths into the organization. Gary could then check with users
whose systems reported the malware to see what had occurred.
Alerts might show the infections but would not show the data
over time as easily as trends. Sensors will show individual places
data is gathered, and bandwidth dashboards can show useful
information about which systems are using more or less
bandwidth, but the trends dashboard remains the right place for
him to look in this situation.
■
138. B. Although it can be easy to focus on the digital part of digital
forensics, interviews with end users and others involved in an
incident can be a key element of a forensic investigation.
Investigators still need to gather information and record what
they found, but an interview can provide firsthand knowledge
and additional details that may not be able to be recovered via
technical means like email or disk forensics. A chain of custody
does not provide information about reports from end users.
139. B. The only option on this list that supports Aaron’s
requirements is NXLog. Syslog can receive Windows events if
they are converted to syslog, but it isn’t a native feature. IPFIX is
a network flow standard, and journalctl is used to access the
systemd journal.
■
140. A. Typical exercise types for most organizations include
simulations that emulate an actual incident response process,
walk-throughs that guide staff through an event, and tabletop
exercises that are gamed out without taking actual action. Drills
are classified as more focused on specific actions or functions,
and they are less common because they can result in inadvertent
action or mistakes and do not cover the breadth of an incident.
141. A. Of the options listed, netstat is the only tool that will not
perform a port scan.
■
142. C. The top of the diamond should be labeled Adversary, one of
the four vertices on the Diamond model.
■
143. C. Electronic discovery, or e-discovery, is the legal proceeding
involved in litigation, FoIA requests, and similar efforts that
produce information in electronic form. Email forensics could
be required to recover data in an investigation, but there is no
indication in the question of any need for forensic investigation.
Inquisitions and provenance are not concepts for the Security+
exam
